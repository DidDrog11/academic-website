<h2>Biography</h2>

I am a current PhD student based in the <a href="https://www.rvc.ac.uk/research/research-centres-and-facilities/ceeed">Centre for Emerging, Endemic and Exotic diseases</a> at the Royal Veterinary College, London. I am funded through a <a href="https://bbsrc.ukri.org/">BBSRC</a> PhD studentship with the <a href="https://www.lido-dtp.ac.uk/">LIDo DTP</a>. I am supervised by an interdisciplinary team of researchers, Prof. Richard Kock (<a href="https://www.rvc.ac.uk/about/our-people/richard-kock">RVC</a>), Prof. Deborah Watson-Jones (<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=csCh6RsAAAAJ">LSHTM</a>) and Prof. Kate Jones (<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/people/prof-kate-jones">UCL-CBER</a>). My research interests fit within the developing field of <a href="https://unfccc.int/climate-action/momentum-for-change/planetary-health">Planetary Health</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/index.html">One Health</a> with a particular focus on the effect of anthropogenic change on the risks of zoonotic infectious disease emergence and subsequent spread. I use systems approaches to understand the interaction between human and biological factors on disease risk. 

My PhD research is predominantly focused on West Africa with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/lassa/index.html">Lassa fever</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/">Monkeypox</a> and <a href="cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/">Ebola</a> as model disease systems. I adopt interdisciplinary approaches using methods from clinical medicine, epidemiology, mathematical modelling and systems biology. I am a member of the <a href="https://pandora.tghn.org/">PANDORA-ID-net</a> consortium and work closely with collaborators on the One Health <a href="https://pandora.tghn.org/one-health/">theme</a>. My field work is conducted with colleagues based at Njala University in Sierra Leone. With this work I aim to develop dynamic models of disease risk and translate these into policy implementations to promote the health and wellbeing of human communities in low resource settings within a planetary health framework. I am also interested in the area of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), another topic benefiting from a One Health approach.

I am a proponent of Open Science with pre-specified research questions and study protocols posted to the <a href="https://osf.io/dashboard">Open Science Framework</a>. I am developing my programming skills and will continue to try and make all code used for my analyses available in reproducible files hosted on my <a href="https://github.com/diddrog11">GitHub</a> page. All data where possible will be hosted on open data repositories and will be linked to the projects contained within this website.

I continue to practice as a clinician with the <a href="http://www.thehtd.org">Hospital for Tropical Diseases</a> and within the emergency department at University College London Hospital.
