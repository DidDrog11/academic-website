Diagnostics for Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) are challenging due to the variability in viral sequence and structure. In developing a cross-species assay to investigate the potential for infection of non-rodent animals we decided to focus assay development on detecting antibodies in serum that could recognise antigenic regions of LASV.

A bioinformatic approach has been taken to identify potential antigen epitopes from previously published sequences on NCBI. This work was written up to be presented at the cancelled ICREID 2020 conference. Below is the poster we produced to describe the workflow for the production of epitopes.
