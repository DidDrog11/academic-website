Current and former smoking is associated with worse outcomes and increased rates of hospitalisation from respiratory infections such as Respiratory Synciatial Virus, Influenza viruses and bacterial infections. Because of this there was an early concern about how the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 may interact with smoking. 

Early data released from healthcare services in China in the early parts of 2020 suggested that smoking was not a significant risk factor for COVID-19 disease. Whether this was a true effect or reflected poor recording or reporting was unclear. We began to synthesise the published and pre-print literature to investigate the specific association of smoking and COVID-19. This was initially performed as a report for the Royal College of Physicians, London and was expanded following a request from Public Health England.

## Living review

We implemented a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m2925">Living Systematic Review</a> methodology due to the rapidly evolving information base.   Searches were conducted monthly and we published our pre-print manuscripts on <a href="https://www.qeios.com/teaser">*Qeios*</a>. Version 7 of this work has been published in the journal [*Addiction*]({{< relref "/publication/living_review_v7">}} "Addiction"), further versions will be released as post-prints to the following address at <a href="https://www.qeios.com/read/latest-UJR2AW">*Qeios*</a>.

## Hospitalised patients case-control study

We performed a case-control study at University College Hospital London NHS Foundation Trust to explore the association of smoking and hospitalisation with COVID-19 compared to other respiratory viruses from the year prior to the pandemic. This work used data extracted from the Electronic Healthcare Records of 657 in-patients. This work has been submitted for peer-review and publication and is currently registered as a pre-print on *medRxiv* the publication is available [here]({{< relref "/publication/covid_smoking_uclh">}}).

I presented an interim analysis of this work at the <a href="https://srnt-e.org/conference/lausanne2020/overview">21st Annual SRNT-E Conference</a> the recorded talk is available below.

## Future work

We are currently preparing two further projects

  1. We are requesting access to the individual level data from the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/previousReleases">ONS National Infection Survey</a> to investigate the association of current, former and never smoking on infection risk and how it changes through the course of the epidemic.
  2. We are also requesting access to the individual level data from the <a href="https://isaric.org/">ISARIC</a> study to investigate the association fo current, former and never smoking on disease severity and in-hospital mortality.
