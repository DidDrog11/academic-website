This work was conducted with Guillaume Fournie based at the RVC who works with the [One Health Poulty](https://www.onehealthpoultry.org/) project. We explored the United Nations [Food and Agriculture Organizations](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#home) data on global chicken production, import and export to understand change over time and the evolving trading networks. 

We wanted to understand how these have evolved over time and the potential for spreading Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) through these networks to inform potential targets for interventions. Global chicken production has increased significantly in the time period we looked at with increasing amounts of intercontinental trade. We are continuing to analyse the networks of trade but the below animated maps highlight these significant changes.

An initial report has been produced for sharing within the project team. It is available [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DidDrog11/chicken_trading/blob/master/trading_matrix_analysis.html). This is an ongoing piece of work.
