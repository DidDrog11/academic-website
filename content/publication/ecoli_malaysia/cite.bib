	abstract = {The 2018 Nigerian Lassa fever season saw the largest ever recorded upsurge of cases, raising concerns over the emergence of a strain with increased transmission rate. To understand the molecular epidemiology of this upsurge, we performed, for the first time at the epicenter of an unfolding outbreak, metagenomic nanopore sequencing directly from patient samples, an approach dictated by the highly variable genome of the target pathogen. Genomic data and phylogenetic reconstructions were communicated immediately to Nigerian authorities and the World Health Organization to inform the public health response. Real-time analysis of 36 genomes and subsequent confirmation using all 120 samples sequenced in the country of origin revealed extensive diversity and phylogenetic intermingling with strains from previous years, suggesting independent zoonotic transmission events and thus allaying concerns of an emergent strain or extensive human-to-human transmission.},

	abstract = {Individuals in low socioeconomic brackets are considered at-risk for developing influenza-related complications and often exhibit higher than average influenza-related hospitalization rates. This disparity has been attributed to various factors, including restricted access to preventative and therapeutic health care, limited sick leave, and household structure. Adequate influenza surveillance in these at-risk populations is a critical precursor to accurate risk assessments and effective intervention. However, the United States of America’s primary national influenza surveillance system (ILINet) monitors outpatient healthcare providers, which may be largely inaccessible to lower socioeconomic populations. Recent initiatives to incorporate Internet-source and hospital electronic medical records data into surveillance systems seek to improve the timeliness, coverage, and accuracy of outbreak detection and situational awareness. Here, we use a flexible statistical framework for integrating multiple surveillance data sources to evaluate the adequacy of traditional (ILINet) and next generation (BioSense 2.0 and Google Flu Trends) data for situational awareness of influenza across poverty levels. We find that ZIP Codes in the highest poverty quartile are a critical vulnerability for ILINet that the integration of next generation data fails to ameliorate.},

Limited data are available characterizing SARS-Cov-2 infection in the United States. Objective: To determine associations between demographic and clinical factors and testing positive for coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19+), and among Covid-19+ subsequent hospitalization and intensive care. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study including all patients tested for Covid-19 between February 8 and March 30, 2020, inclusive. We extracted electronic health record data from the national Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, on 2,026,227 patients born between 1945 and 1965 and active in care. Exposures: Demographic data, comorbidities, medication history, substance use, vital signs, and laboratory measures. Laboratory tests were analyzed first individually and then grouped into a validated summary measure of physiologic injury (VACS Index). Main Outcomes and Measures: We evaluated which factors were associated with Covid-19+ among all who tested. Among Covid-19+ we identified factors associated with hospitalization or intensive care. We identified independent associations using multivariable and conditional multivariable logistic regression with multiple imputation of missing values. Results: Among Veterans aged 54-75 years, 585/3,789 (15.4\%) tested Covid-19+. In adjusted analysis (C-statistic=0.806) black race was associated with Covid-19+ (OR 4.68, 95\% CI 3.79-5.78) and the association remained in analyses conditional on site (OR 2.56, 95\% CI 1.89-3.46). In adjusted models, laboratory abnormalities (especially fibrosis-4 score [FIB-4] \&gt;3.25 OR 8.73, 95\% CI 4.11-18.56), and VACS Index (per 5-point increase OR 1.62, 95\% CI 1.43-1.84) were strongly associated with hospitalization. Associations were similar for intensive care. Although significant in unadjusted analyses, associations with comorbid conditions and medications were substantially reduced and, in most cases, no longer significant after adjustment. Conclusions and Relevance: Black race was strongly associated with Covid-19+, but not with hospitalization or intensive care. Among Covid-19+, risk of hospitalization and intensive care may be better characterized by laboratory measures and vital signs than by comorbid conditions or prior medication exposure.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background With evidence of sustained transmission in more than 190 countries, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic. As such, data are urgently needed about risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. Methods A retrospective chart review of 323 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan was conducted. Patients were classified into three disease severity groups (non-severe, severe, and critical), based on their initial clinical presentation. Clinical outcomes were designated as favorable and unfavorable, based on disease progression and response to treatments. Logistic regression models were performed to identify factors associated with clinical outcomes, and logrank test was conducted for the association with clinical progression. Results Current standard treatments did not show significant improvement on patient outcomes in the study. By univariate logistic regression model, 27 risk factors were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Further, multivariate regression indicated that age over 65 years, smoking, critical disease status, diabetes, high hypersensitive troponin I (\&gt;0.04 pg/mL), leukocytosis (\&gt;10 x 109/L) and neutrophilia (\&gt;75 x 109/L) predicted unfavorable clinical outcomes. By contrast, the use of hypnotics was significantly associated with favorable outcomes. Survival analysis also confirmed that patients receiving hypnotics had significantly better survival. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first indication that hypnotics could be an effective ancillary treatment for COVID-19. We also found that novel risk factors, such as higher hypersensitive troponin I, predicted poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides useful data to guide early clinical decision making to reduce mortality and improve clinical outcomes of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is evolving rapidly worldwide.
Objective To evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 by stratifying the comorbidity status.
Methods We analysed data from 1590 laboratory confirmed hospitalised patients from 575 hospitals in 31 provinces/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between 11 December 2019 and 31 January 2020. We analysed the composite end-points, which consisted of admission to an intensive care unit, invasive ventilation or death. The risk of reaching the composite end-points was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities.
Results The mean age was 48.9 years and 686 (42.7\%) patients were female. Severe cases accounted for 16.0\% of the study population. 131 (8.2\%) patients reached the composite end-points. 399 (25.1\%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9\%), followed by diabetes (8.2\%). 130 (8.2\%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD (HR (95\% CI) 2.681 (1.424–5.048)), diabetes (1.59 (1.03–2.45)), hypertension (1.58 (1.07–2.32)) and malignancy (3.50 (1.60–7.64)) were risk factors of reaching the composite end-points. The hazard ratio (95\% CI) was 1.79 (1.16–2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (1.61–4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities.
Conclusion Among laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.

	abstract = {Objective The SARS-CoV-2-infected disease (COVID-19) outbreak is a major threat to human beings. Previous studies mainly focused on Wuhan and typical symptoms. We analysed 74 confirmed COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms in the Zhejiang province to determine epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics.
Design COVID-19 hospital patients were admitted in the Zhejiang province from 17 January 2020 to 8 February 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, management and outcome data of patients with GI symptoms were analysed using multivariate analysis for risk of severe/critical type. Bioinformatics were used to analyse features of SARS-CoV-2 from Zhejiang province.
Results Among enrolled 651 patients, 74 (11.4\%) presented with at least one GI symptom (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea), average age of 46.14 years, 4-day incubation period and 10.8\% had pre-existing liver disease. Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 17 (22.97\%) and 23 (31.08\%) had severe/critical types and family clustering, respectively, significantly higher than those without GI symptoms, 47 (8.14\%) and 118 (20.45\%). Of patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms, 29 (39.19\%), 23 (31.08\%), 8 (10.81\%) and 16 (21.62\%) had significantly higher rates of fever {\textgreater}38.5°C, fatigue, shortness of breath and headache, respectively. Low-dose glucocorticoids and antibiotics were administered to 14.86\% and 41.89\% of patients, respectively. Sputum production and increased lactate dehydrogenase/glucose levels were risk factors for severe/critical type. Bioinformatics showed sequence mutation of SARS-CoV-2 with m6A methylation and changed binding capacity with ACE2.
Conclusion We report COVID-19 cases with GI symptoms with novel features outside Wuhan. Attention to patients with COVID-19 with non-classic symptoms should increase to protect health providers.},

Design Retrospective case series.
Setting Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.
Participants Among a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were analysed. Data were collected until 28 February 2020.
Main outcome measures Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records with data collection forms.
Results The median age of deceased patients (68 years) was significantly older than recovered patients (51 years). Male sex was more predominant in deceased patients (83; 73\%) than in recovered patients (88; 55\%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent among deceased patients (54 (48\%) and 16 (14\%)) than recovered patients (39 (24\%) and 7 (4\%)). Dyspnoea, chest tightness, and disorder of consciousness were more common in deceased patients (70 (62\%), 55 (49\%), and 25 (22\%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31\%), 48 (30\%), and 1 (1\%)). The median time from disease onset to death in deceased patients was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days. Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50\%) patients who died and 6 (4\%) who recovered, and lymphopenia was present in 103 (91\%) and 76 (47\%) respectively. Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer were markedly higher in deceased patients than in recovered patients. Common complications observed more frequently in deceased patients included acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100\%), type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51\%), sepsis (113; 100\%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77\%), heart failure (41/83; 49\%), alkalosis (14/35; 40\%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37\%), acute kidney injury (28; 25\%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20\%). Patients with cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to develop cardiac complications. Regardless of history of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and heart failure were more common in deceased patients.
Conclusion Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction in patients at high risk. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most common critical complications during exacerbation of covid-19.},

We aim to describe here the various clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases. Methods Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected, and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed. Results The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe. Conclusion All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic.},

Method: In this descriptive study, we obtained epidemiological, demographic, manifestations, laboratory data and radiological ﬁndings of patients conﬁrmed by real-time RT-PCR in the NO.2 People’s Hospital of Fuyang City from Jan 20 to Feb 9, 2020. Clinical outcomes were followed up to Feb 18, 2020.
Results: Of 125 patients infected SARS-CoV-2, the mean age was 38.76 years (SD, 13.799) and 71(56.8\%) were male. Common symptoms include fever [116 (92.8\%)], cough [102(81.6\%)], and shortness of breath [57(45.6\%)]. Lymphocytopenia developed in 48(38.4\%) patients. 100(80.0\%) patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 26(20.8\%) patients showed multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity. All patients were given antiviral therapy. 19(15.2\%) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit. By February 18, 47 (37.6\%) patients were discharged and none of patients died. Among the discharged patients, the median time of length of stay was 14.8 days (SD 4.16).
Conclusion: In this single-center, retrospective, descriptive study, fever is the most common symptom. Old age, chronic underlying diseases and smoking history may be risk factors to worse condition. Certain laboratory inspection may contribute to the judgment of the severity of illness.},

Methods Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed. Results An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7\%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community-acquired cases. Fever (91.7\%), cough (75.0\%), fatigue (75.0\%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6\%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0\%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1\%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4\%) and urticaria (1.4\%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4\%) patients and current smokers (1.4\%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity (89.6\%) was the most common sign of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4\%) and eosinopenia (52.9\%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .486, P {\textless} .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P {\textless} .001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients (all P {\textless} .001). Conclusion Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

	abstract = {The outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China (SARS-CoV-2) that began in December 2019 presents a significant and urgent threat to global health. This study was conducted to provide the international community with a deeper understanding of this new infectious disease. Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings, radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 135 patients in northeast Chongqing were collected and analyzed in this study. A total of 135 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The median age was 47 years (interquartile range, 36-55), and there was no significant gender difference (53.3\% men). The majority of patients had contact with people from the Wuhan area. Forty-three (31.9\%) patients had underlying disease, primarily hypertension (13 [9.6\%]), diabetes (12 [8.9\%]), cardiovascular disease (7 [5.2\%]), and malignancy (4 [3.0\%]). Common symptoms included fever (120 [88.9\%]), cough (102 [76.5\%]), and fatigue (44 [32.5\%]). Chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs of all the patients. All patients received antiviral therapy (135 [100\%]) (Kaletra and interferon were both used), antibacterial therapy (59 [43.7\%]), and corticosteroids (36 [26.7\%]). In addition, many patients received traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) (124 [91.8\%]). It is suggested that patients should receive Kaletra early and should be treated by a combination of Western and Chinese medicines. Compared to the mild cases, the severe ones had lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma levels of Pt, APTT, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, PCT, ALB, C-reactive protein, and aspartate aminotransferase. This study demonstrates the clinic features and therapies of 135 COVID-19 patients. Kaletra and TCM played an important role in the treatment of the viral pneumonia. Further studies are required to explore the role of Kaletra and TCM in the treatment of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Background 
        Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia.
        Methods 
        Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression.
        Results 
        Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1\%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9\%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3\% vs. 3.0\%, χ2 = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5\% vs. 20.9\%, χ2 = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 ± 6.60 vs. 41.27 ± 4.55 g/L, U = 2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (χ2 = 16.01, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628–44.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95\% CI: 1.577–25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95\% CI: 1.036–78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95\% CI: 1.942–40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95\% CI: 1.098–50.000; P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95\% CI: 1.224−34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression.
        Conclusions 
        Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature at admission, respiratory failure, albumin, and C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with abnormal imaging ﬁndings.
Methods: Patients conﬁrmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Zhejiang province from January 17 to February 8 who had undergone CT or X-ray were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical data were analyzed among those with abnormal or normal imaging ﬁndings.
Results: Excluding 72 patients with normal images, 230 of 573 patients showed abnormalities affecting more than two lung lobes. The median radiographic score was 2.0, and there was a negative correlation between that score and the oxygenation index (r = À0.657, P {\textless} 0.001). Patients with abnormal images were older (46.65 Æ 13.82), with a higher rate of coexisting condition (28.8\%), a lower rate of exposure history, and longer time between onset and conﬁrmation (5 days) than non-pneumonia patients (all P {\textless} 0.05). A higher rate of fever, cough, expectoration and headache, a lower level of lymphocytes, albumin, and serum sodium levels and a higher total bilirubin, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and Creactive protein levels and a lower oxygenation index were observed in pneumonia patients (all P {\textless} 0.05). Muscle ache, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes levels, and higher serum creatinine and radiographic score at admission were predictive factors for the severe/critical subtype.
Conclusion: Patients with abnormal images have more obvious clinical manifestations and laboratory changes. Combing clinical features and radiographic scores can effectively predict severe/critical types. © 2020 The Author(s).

The mean (SD) age was 58.50 (14.66) years. Overall, 66 (35.3\%) had underlying CVD including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 52 (27.8\%) exhibited myocardial injury as indicated by elevated TnT levels. The mortality during hospitalization was 7.62\% (8 of 105) for patients without underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 13.33\% (4 of 30) for those with underlying CVD and normal TnT levels, 37.50\% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD but elevated TnT levels, and 69.44\% (25 of 36) for those with underlying CVD and elevated TnTs. Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to exhibit elevation of TnT levels compared with the patients without CVD (36 [54.5\%] vs 16 [13.2\%]). Plasma TnT levels demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (β = 0.530,\textit{P} \&lt; .001) and N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels (β = 0.613,\textit{P} \&lt; .001). Plasma TnT and NT-proBNP levels during hospitalization (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 0.307 [0.094-0.600]; 1902.00 [728.35-8100.00]) and impending death (median [IQR], 0.141 [0.058-0.860]; 5375 [1179.50-25695.25]) increased significantly compared with admission values (median [IQR], 0.0355 [0.015-0.102]; 796.90 [401.93-1742.25]) in patients who died (\textit{P} = .001;\textit{P} \&lt; .001), while no significant dynamic changes of TnT (median [IQR], 0.010 [0.007-0.019]; 0.013 [0.007-0.022]; 0.011 [0.007-0.016]) and NT-proBNP (median [IQR], 352.20 [174.70-636.70]; 433.80 [155.80-1272.60]; 145.40 [63.4-526.50]) was observed in survivors (\textit{P} = .96;\textit{P} = .16). During hospitalization, patients with elevated TnT levels had more frequent malignant arrhythmias, and the use of glucocorticoid therapy (37 [71.2\%] vs 69 [51.1\%]) and mechanical ventilation (31 [59.6\%] vs 14 [10.4\%]) were higher compared with patients with normal TnT levels.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain a huge threat to the public health worldwide. Clinical data is limited up to now regarding the risk factors in favor of severe conversion of non-severe case with COVID-19. Aims: This study analyzed a hospital staff data to figure out general clinical features of COVID-19 in terms of the association of cardiovascular manifestations (CVMs) with in-hospital outcomes of COVID-19 cases. Methods: Retrospective, single-center case series of 41 consecutive hospitalized health staff with confirmed COVID-19 were collected at the Central Hospital of Wuhan in Wuhan, China, from January 15 to January 24, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment data and in-hospital adverse events were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was March 3, 2020. A comparative study was applied between cases with CVMs and those without CVMs. Results: Of all, clinicians and clinical nurses accounted for 80.5\%, while 87.8\% of all had history of patient contact. The population was presented with a mean age of 39.1 +- 9.2 and less comorbidities than community population. The three most frequent symptoms of COVID-19 cases analyzed were fever (82.9\%), myalgia or fatigue (80.5\%) and cough (63.4\%). While, the three most frequent initial symptoms were myalgia or fatigue (80.5\%), fever (73.2\%) and cough (41.5\%). There were 95.1\% cases featured as non-severe course of disease according to the official standard in China. Patients with CVMs and those without CVMs accounted for 58.5\% and 41.5\%, respectively. Compared with cases without CVMs, patients with CVMs were presented with lower baseline lymphocyte count (0.99 +- 0.43 and 1.55 +- 0.61, P\&lt;0.001), more who had at least once positive nucleic acid detection of throat swab during admission (50.0\% and 11.8\%, P=0.011), and more received oxygen support (79.2\% and 23.5\%, P\&lt;0.001). The rate of in-hospital adverse events was significantly higher in patients with CVMs group (75.0\% and 23.5\%, P=0.001). Multivariable logistic regression model indicated that, coexisting with CVMs in COVID-19 patients was not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events. Conclusions: Most of hospital staff with COVID-19 had history of patient contact, featured non-severe course of disease. Cases with CVMs suffered from more in-hospital adverse events than those without CVMs. But concomitant CVMs were not independently associated with in-hospital adverse events in COVID-19 patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background Although the outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused over 2200 deaths in China, there was no study about death yet. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of non-survivors with COVID-19. Methods For this retrospective, single-center study, we included 36 non-survivors with COVID-19 in the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan. Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR between Jan 21 and Feb 10, 2020 according to the recommended protocol. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes were followed up until Feb 14, 2020. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, with a waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation. Results We included 36 patients who died from COVID-19. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). 25(69.44\%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56\%) female. 26 (72.22\%) patients had chronic diseases, mainly including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Patients had common clinical symptoms of fever (34 [94.44\%] patients), cough (28 [77.78\%] patients), shortness of breath (21 [58.33\%] patients), and fatigue (17 [47.22\%] patient). Chest computed tomographic scans showed that 31 (96.88\%) patients had bilateral pneumonia. Lymphopenia occurred in 24 patients (70.59\%), decreased albumin (30.18, [SD, 4.76]) in 25 patients (80.65\%), elevated D-dimer (8.64 [IQR, 2.39-20]) in 27 patients (100\%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (502.5 U/L [IQR, 410-629]) in 26 patients (100\%). Nearly all of the patients have elevated CRP (106.3 mg/L [IQR, 60.83-225.3]), PCT (0.61 ng/ml [IQR, 0.16-2.10]) and IL-6 (100.6 pg/ml [IQR, 51.51-919.5]). Most patients received antiviral therapy and antibiotic therapy, and more than half of patients received glucocorticoid therapy (25 [69.44\%]). All the patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. One (2.78\%) patient presented with acute renal injury. The median time from onset to death was 17 days. Interpretation Lots of patients died from COVID-19 till now. The median survival time of these non-survivors from onset to death was about 2 weeks. Most patients were older males with comorbidities. They finally progressed to ARDS. The median time from onset to ARDS was 11 days. Gradually decreased lymphocytes and increased inflammation biomarkers were common, and need to be monitored in the routine treatment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Since the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. Methods: We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25\%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged \&gt;60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p\&lt;0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Cardiac complications are common in COVID-19 patients. Elevated CRP levels, underlying comorbidities, and NCP severity are the main risk factors for cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We analyzed data on the 17 confirmed cases in Dazhou to provide the epidemiologic characteristics of NCP outside Wuhan. Among them, 12 patients were still quarantined in the hospital, 5 patients were discharged NCP patients according to the national standards. Compared with non-discharged NCP patients, the discharged NCP patients had younger ages. Moreover, discharged NCP patients had higher heart rate, lymphocytes levels and monocytes levels than non-discharged NCP patients on admission to the hospital. Notably, all of 17 patients had abnormal increased C-reactive protein levels, and 16 patients had abnormal computed tomography images.

	abstract = {Background: Since the confirmation of the first patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Spain in January 2020, the epidemic has grown rapidly, with the greatest impact on the region of Madrid. This article describes the first 2226 adult patients with COVID-19, consecutively admitted to La Paz University Hospital in Madrid. Methods: Our cohort included all patients consecutively hospitalized who had a final outcome (death or discharge) in a 1286-bed hospital of Madrid (Spain) from 25 February (first case admitted) to 19 April 2020. The data were manually entered into an electronic case report form, which was monitored prior to the analysis. Results: We consecutively included 2226 adult patients admitted to the hospital who either died (460) or were discharged (1766). The patients’ median age was 61 years, and 51.8\% were women. The most common comorbidity was arterial hypertension (41.3\%), and the most common symptom on admission was fever (71.2\%). The median time from disease onset to hospital admission was 6 days. The overall mortality was 20.7\% and was higher in men (26.6\% vs. 15.1\%). Seventy-five patients with a final outcome were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) (3.4\%). Most patients admitted to the ICU were men, and the median age was 64 years. Baseline laboratory values on admission were consistent with an impaired immune-inflammatory profile. Conclusions: We provide a description of the first large cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Europe. Advanced age, male sex, the presence of comorbidities and abnormal laboratory values were more common among the patients with fatal outcomes.},

There is unprecedented urgency to understand who is most at risk of severe outcomes, requiring new approaches for timely analysis of large datasets. Working on behalf of NHS England, here we created OpenSAFELY: a secure health analytics platform covering 40\% of all patients in England, holding patient data within the existing data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor. Primary care records of 17,278,392 adults were pseudonymously linked to 10,926 COVID-19-related deaths. COVID-19-related death was associated with: being male (hazard ratio (HR) 1.59, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.53–1.65); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); diabetes; severe asthma; and various other medical conditions. Compared with people with white ethnicity, Black and South Asian people were at higher risk even after adjustment for other factors (HR 1.48, 1.30–1.69 and 1.44, 1.32–1.58, respectively). We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for COVID-19-related death in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. OpenSAFELY is rapidly adding further patients’ records; we will update and extend results regularly.},

Our objective was to identify early prognostic factors upon admission to optimize the management of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a medical ward. Methods: French single-center prospective cohort study of 152 patients with positive Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, hospitalized in a medical ward. Multivariable models and a simplified scoring system assessed predictive factors of intensive care unit (ICU) transfer or death at day 14 (D14), of being discharge alive and severe status at D14 (remaining with ventilation, or death). A validation was performed on an external sample of 132 patients. Findings: At D14, the probability of ICU transfer or death was 32\% (95\% CI 25-40). Older age (OR 2.61, 95\% CI 0.96-7.10), poorer respiratory presentation (OR 4.04 per 1-point increment on World Health Organization (WHO) clinical scale, 95\% CI 1.76-9.25), higher CRP-level (OR 1.63 per 100mg/L increment, 95\% CI 0.98-2.71) and lower lymphocytes count (OR 0.36 per 1000/mm3 increment, 95\% CI 0.13-0.99) were associated with an increased risk of ICU requirement or death. A 8-point ordinal scale scoring system defined low (score 0-2), moderate (score 3-5), and high (score 6-8) risk patients, with predicted respectively 2\%, 25\% and 81\% risk of ICU transfer or death at D14. Interpretation: In this prospective cohort study of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a medical ward in France, 32\% were transferred to ICU or died. A simplified scoring system at admission predicted the outcome at D14.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Population-based studies from China and Italy suggested a higher COVID-19 death rate in patients with cancer2,3, although there is a knowledge gap as to which aspects of cancer and its treatment confer risk of severe COVID-19 disease4. This information is critical to balance the competing safety considerations of reducing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and cancer treatment continuation. Since March 10th, 2020 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center performed diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients. Overall, 40\% out of 423 patients with cancer were hospitalized for COVID-19 illness, 20\% developed severe respiratory illness, including 9\% that required mechanical ventilation, and 9\% that died. On multivariate analysis, age ≥ 65 years and treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) within 90 days were predictors for hospitalization and severe disease, while receipt of chemotherapy within 30 days and major surgery were not. Overall, COVID-19 illness is associated with higher rates of hospitalization and severe outcomes in patients with cancer. Association between ICI and COVID-19 outcomes will need interrogation in tumor-specific cohorts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are regularly complicated by respiratory failure. While it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. To better understand the potential role of neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status. Patients with COVID-19 (n=172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n=94 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 +/- 7031 ng/ml, n=32) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3365 +/- 3146, p\&lt;0.0001). In summary, serum calprotectin levels track closely with current and future COVID-19 severity, implicating neutrophils as potential perpetuators of inflammation and respiratory compromise in COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Design:Retrospective case series. Setting:Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Participants:From 4 February to 14 April 2020, 106 patients with neurological diseases were enrolled from all patients in the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 and divided into a severe group and a nonsevere group according to their COVID-19 diagnosis. Main outcome measures:Clinical characteristics, laboratory results, imaging findings, and treatment methods were all retrieved through an electronic medical records system and recorded in spreadsheets. Results:The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of patients was 72.7 (11.8) years, and 64 patients were male (60.4\%). Among patients with co-morbid neurological diseases, 81 had a previous cerebral infarction (76.4\%), 20 had dementia (18.9\%), 10 had acute cerebral infarction (9.4\%), 5 had sequelae of cerebral haemorrhage (4.7\%), 4 had intracranial mass lesions (3.8\%), 3 had epilepsy (2.8\%), 2 had Parkinsons disease (1.9\%), and 1 had myelopathy (0.9\%). Fever (n = 62, 58.5\%) was the most common symptom. The most common neurological symptoms were myalgia (n = 26, 24.5\%), followed by extremity paralysis (n = 20, 18.9\%), impaired consciousness (n = 17, 16\%), and positive focal neurological signs (n = 42, 39.6\%). Eight patients (7.5\%) died. There were more patients with altered mental status in the severe group than in the non-severe group (6 [10.2\%] vs. 0, P = 0.033). The inflammatory response in the severe group was more significant than that in the non-severe group. There were more patients taking anticoagulant drugs (25 [42.4\%] vs. 4 [8.5\%], P \&lt; 0.001) and sedative drugs (22 [37.3\%] vs. 9 [19.1\%], P = 0.041) in the severe group than in the non-severe group. Amid all 93 patients with cerebrovascular diseases, only 32 (34.4\%) were taking aspirin, 13 (14\%) taking clopidogrel, and 33 (35.5\%) taking statins. Conclusions:Patients with COVID-19 with co-morbid neurological diseases had an advanced age, a high rate of severe illness, and a high mortality rate.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}OBJECTIVE To describe the clinical characteristics and epidemiological features of severe (non-ICU) and critically patients (ICU) with COVID-19 at triage, prior hospitalization, in one of the main hospitals in The Balearic Islands health care system. DESIGN Retrospective observational study SETTING Son Llatzer University Hospital in Palma de Mallorca (Spain) PARTICIPANTS Among a cohort of 52 hospitalized patients as of 31 March 2020, 48 with complete demographic information and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive test, were analyzed. Data were collected between March 15th, 2020, and March 31th 2020, inclusive of these dates. MAIN OUTCOMES Clinical, vital signs and routine laboratory outcomes at the time of hospitalization, including symptoms reported prior to hospitalization. Demographics and baseline comorbidities were also collected. Mortality was reported at the end of the study. RESULTS 48 patients (27 non-ICU and 21 ICU) resident in Mallorca, Spain (mean age, 66 years, [range, 33-88 years]; 67\% males) with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. There were no differences in age or sex among groups (p \&gt;.05). Initial symptoms included fever (100\%), coughing (85\%), dyspnea (76\%), diarrhea (42\%) and asthenia (21\%). The majority of patients in this case series were hospitalized because of low SpO2 (SpO2 below 90\%) and presentation of bilateral pneumonia (94\%) at triage. ICU patients had a higher prevalence of dyspnea compared to non-ICU patients (95\% vs 61\%, p = .022). Acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) was presented in 100\% of the ICU-patients. All the patients included in the study required oxygen therapy. ICU-patients had lymphopenia as well as hypoalbuminemia. Inflammatory markers such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin were significantly higher in ICU patients compared to non-ICU (p \&lt; .001).Lower albumin levels were associated with poor prognosis measured as longer hospital length (r= -0.472, p \&lt;.001) and mortality (r= -0.424, p=.003). Interestingly we also found, that MCV was lower among of those patients who died (p=.0002). As of April 28, 2020, 10 patients (8 ICU and 2 non-ICU) had died (21\% mortality) and while 100\% of the non-ICU patients had been discharged, 33\% of ICU patients still remained hospitalized (5 in ICU and 2 had been transferred to ward). CONCLUSION Critically ill patients with COVID-19 present lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia as well high levels of inflammation. Lower levels of albumin were associated with poorer outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Albumin might be of importance because of its association with disease severity in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We retrospectively investigated COVID-19 patients positively confirmed by nucleic acid Q-PCR at Taihe Hospital from January 16 to February 4, 2020. Their epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and imaging characteristics were analysed.
Results
Among the 73 patients studied, 12.3 \% developed symptoms after returning to Shiyan from Wuhan, and 71.2 \% had a history of close contact with Wuhan personnel or confirmed cases. Among these patients, 9 cases were associated with family clustering. The first main symptoms presented by these patients were fever (84.9 \%) and cough (21.9 \%). The longest incubation period was 26 days, and the median interval from the first symptoms to admission was 5 days. Of the patients, 67.1 \% were originally healthy people with no underlying diseases, others mostly had common comorbidities including hypertension (12.3 \%) and diabetes (5.5 \%), 10.9 \% were current smokers, 30.1 \% had low white blood cell counts and 45.2 \% showed decreased lymphocytes at the first time of diagnosis. CT scans showed that multiple patchy ground glass shadows outside of the patient lungs were commonly observed, and a single sub-pleural sheet of ground glass shadow with enhanced vascular bundles was also found located under the pleura. Patient follow-up to February 14 presented 38.4 \% severe cases and 2.7 \% critical cases. After follow-up, the parameter of lymphocyte counts below 0.8 × 109/L cannot be used to predict severe and critical groups from the ordinary group, and a lower proportion of smokers and higher proportion of diabetes patients occur in the poor outcome group. Other co-morbidities are observed but did not lead to poor outcomes.
Conclusion
The epidemiological characteristics of patients in the area around Wuhan, such as Shiyan, at first diagnosis are described as follows: Patients had histories of Wuhan residences in the early stage and family clustering in the later period. The incubation period was relatively long, and the incidence was relatively hidden, but the virulence was relatively low. The initial diagnosis of the patients was mostly ordinary, and the percentage of critical patients who evolved into the ICU during follow-up is 2.7 \%, which is lower than the 26.1 \% reported by Wuhan city. According to the Shiyan experience, early diagnosis with multiple swaps of the Q-PCR test and timely treatment can reduce the death rate. Diabetes could be one of the risk factors for progression to severe/critical outcomes. No evidence exists that smoking protects COVID-19 patients from developing to severe/critical cases, and the absolute number of lymphocytes at initial diagnosis could not predict the progression risk from severe to critical condition. Multivariate regression analysis should be used to further guide the allocation of clinical resources.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a major global threat that has already caused more than 100,000 deaths worldwide. It is characterized by distinct patterns of disease progression implying a diverse host immune response. However, the immunological features and molecular mechanisms involved in Covid-19 severity remain so far poorly known. Methods: We performed an integrated immune analysis that included in-depth phenotypical profiling of immune cells, whole-blood transcriptomic and cytokine quantification on a cohort of fifty Covid19 patients with a spectrum of disease severity. All patient were tested 8 to 12 days following first symptoms and in absence of anti-inflammatory therapy. Results: A unique phenotype in severe and critically ill patients was identified. It consists in a profoundly impaired interferon (IFN) type I response characterized by a low interferon production and activity, with consequent downregulation of interferon-stimulated genes. This was associated with a persistent blood virus load and an exacerbated inflammatory response that was partially driven by the transcriptional factor NFκB. It was also characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 production and signaling as well as increased innate immune chemokines. Conclusion: We propose that type-I IFN deficiency in the blood is a hallmark of severe Covid-19 and could identify and define a high-risk population. Our study provides a rationale for testing IFN administration combined with adapted anti-inflammatory therapy targeting IL-6 or TNF-α in most severe patients. These data also raise concern for utilization of drugs that interfere with the IFN pathway.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background The mortality of COVID-19 differs between countries and regions. By now, reports on COVID-19 are largely focused on first-generation cases. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of imported and second-generation cases. Methods This retrospective, multicenter cohort study included 134 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 9 cities outside Wuhan. Epidemiological, clinical and outcome data were extracted from medical records and were compared between severe and non-severe cases. We further profiled the dynamic laboratory findings of some patients. Results 34.3\% of the 134 patients were severe cases, and 11.2\% had complications. As of March 7, 2020, 91.8\% patients were discharged and one patient (0.7\%) died. The median age was 46 years. The median interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4.5 (IQR 3-7) days. The median lymphocyte count was 1.1*109/L. Age, lymphocyte count, CRP, ESR, DBIL, LDH, HBDH showed difference between severe and no-severe cases (all P\&lt;0.05). Baseline lymphocyte count was higher in the survived patients than in the non-survivor case, and it increased as the condition improved, but declined sharply when death occurred. The IL-6 level displayed a downtrend in survivors, but rose very high in the death case. Pulmonary fibrosis was found on later chest CT images in 51.5\% of the pneumonia cases. Conclusion Imported and second-generation cases outside Wuhan had a better prognosis than initial cases in Wuhan. Lymphocyte count and IL-6 level could be used for evaluating prognosis. Pulmonary fibrosis as the sequelae of COVID-19 should be taken into account.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background: Despite limited and conﬂicting evidence, hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is widely used in COVID-19 therapy.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study of electronic health records of patients hospitalized with conﬁrmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in US Veterans Health Administration medical centers between March 9, 2020 and April 29, 2020. Patients hospitalized within 24 h of diagnosis were classiﬁed based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or with azithromycin (HC+AZ) or no HC as treatments. The primary outcomes were mortality and use of mechanical ventilation. Findings: A total of 807 patients were evaluated. Compared to the no HC group, after propensity score adjustment for clinical characteristics, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.83; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.16–2.89; p = 0.009), but not in the HC+AZ group (aHR, 1.31; 95\% CI, 0.80–2.15; p = 0.28). Both the propensity-score-adjusted risks of mechanical ventilation and death after mechanical ventilation were not signiﬁcantly different in the HC group (aHR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 0.78–1.82; p = 0.42 and aHR, 2.11; 95\% CI, 0.96–4.62; p = 0.06, respectively) or in the HC+AZ group (aHR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.72–1.66; p = 0.69 and aHR, 1.25; 95\% CI, 0.59–2.68; p = 0.56, respectively) compared to the no HC group.
Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, this retrospective study did not identify any signiﬁcant reduction in mortality or in the need for mechanical ventilation with hydroxychloroquine treatment with or without azithromycin.},

Setting: This study was conducted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Spain). Methods: A cohort analysis of seven patients with SCI infected by Covid-19 was carried out. Diagnosis was confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal exudate or sputum samples. Clinical, analytical and radiographic findings were registered. Results: RT-PCR detected COVID-19 infection in all patients, affecting males and people with a cervical level of injury more often (5 out 7). The average delay for diagnostic confirmation was 4 days (interquartile range, 1-10). Fever was the most frequent symptom (6 out of 7). The second most common symptom was asthenia (4 out of 7), followed by dyspnea, cough and expectoration (3 out of 7 for each symptom). The MEWS score for Covid-19 severity rating was classified as severe in 5 out of 7. All but one patient showed radiological alterations evident in chest X-Rays at the time of diagnosis. All patients recovered gradually. Conclusion: Our patients with SCI and Covid-19 infection exhibited fewer symptoms than the general population. Furthermore, they presented similar or greater clinical severity. The clinical evolution was not as pronounced as had been expected. This study recommends close supervision of the SCI population to detect early compatible signs and symptoms of Covid-19 infection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a world-wide emergency. Fangcang shelter hospitals have been applied in COVID-19 to ease ongoing shortage of medical resources in Wuhan since February 2020. Methods This study enrolled all cases (no=1848) with mild or moderate type of COVID-19 in Fangcang shelter hospital of Jianghan in Wuhan from Feb 5th to Mar 9th, 2020. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on the National health commission of China. Epidemiological history, comorbidity, vital signs, symptoms and signs were recorded in detail. Laboratory tests included biochemical indicators and nucleic acid tests by throat swabs have been performed as well. Findings A total of 1327 patients reached the criteria of isolation release. Meanwhile, 521 patients have been transferred to the designated hospitals for further treatment, including severe type, fever more than 3 days, and severe comorbidity. The case-severity rate (rate of mild or moderate type transforming to severe type) was 3.0\% in the shelter hospital. The patients from mild or moderate type to severe type showed the following clinical characteristics: the median incubation (onset to shelter) period was 10 days; they were all symptomatic at admission; fever, cough, and fatigue were the most common symptoms; hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart diseases were common co-morbidities; most of the patients had elevated levels of CRP at ill onset with 33.3\% over 10 mg per L; bilateral distribution and ground-glass opacity were the most common manifestations in chest CT. Interpretation The potential risk factors of fever, fatigue, high level of C-reactive protein were the risk factors to identify the progression of COVID-19 patients with mild or moderate type. Fangcang shelter hospitals have substantially reduced the time from the onset of severe symptoms transfer to a designated hospital. Early application of the Fangcang shelter hospital may contribute to decrease the ratio of mild transforming to severe patients. Funding No specific grant from any funding was applied to this research.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The Oise department in France has been heavily affected by COVID-19 in early 2020. Methods: Between 30 March and 4 April 2020, we conducted a retrospective closed cohort study among pupils, their parents and siblings, as well as teachers and non-teaching staff of a high-school located in Oise. Participants completed a questionnaire that covered history of fever and/or respiratory symptoms since 13 January 2020 and had blood tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The infection attack rate (IAR) was defined as the proportion of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection based on antibody detection. Blood samples from two blood donor centres collected between 23 and 27 March 2020 in the Oise department were also tested for presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Findings: Of the 661 participants (median age: 37 years), 171 participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The overall IAR was 25.9\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 22.6-29.4), and the infection fatality rate was 0\% (one-sided 97.5\% CI = 0-2.1). Nine of the ten participants hospitalised since mid-January were in the infected group, giving a hospitalisation rate of 5.3\% (95\% CI = 2.4-9.8). Anosmia and ageusia had high positive predictive values for SARS-CoV-2 infection (84.7\% and 88.1\%, respectively). Smokers had a lower IAR compared to non-smokers (7.2\% versus 28.0\%, P \&lt;0.001). The proportion of infected individuals who had no symptoms during the study period was 17.0\% (95\% CI = 11.2-23.4). The proportion of donors with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in two nearby blood banks of the Oise department was 3.0\% (95\% CI = 1.1-6.4). Interpretation: The relatively low IAR observed in an area where SARS-CoV-2 actively circulated weeks before confinement measures indicates that establishing herd immunity will take time, and that lifting these measures in France will be long and complex.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The most common comorbidities were hypertension (3026; 56.6\%), obesity (1737; 41.7\%), and diabetes (1808; 33.8\%). At triage, 30.7\% of patients were febrile, 17.3\% had a respiratory rate greater than 24 breaths/min, and 27.8\% received supplemental oxygen. The rate of respiratory virus co-infection was 2.1\%. Outcomes were assessed for 2634 patients who were discharged or had died at the study end point. During hospitalization, 373 patients (14.2\%) (median age, 68 years [IQR, 56-78]; 33.5\% female) were treated in the intensive care unit care, 320 (12.2\%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, 81 (3.2\%) were treated with kidney replacement therapy, and 553 (21\%) died. As of April 4, 2020, for patients requiring mechanical ventilation (n = 1151, 20.2\%), 38 (3.3\%) were discharged alive, 282 (24.5\%) died, and 831 (72.2\%) remained in hospital. The median postdischarge follow-up time was 4.4 days (IQR, 2.2-9.3). A total of 45 patients (2.2\%) were readmitted during the study period.

	abstract = {As of April 18, 2020, 2.16 million patients in the world had been tested positive with Coronavirus (COVID-19) and 146,088 had died, which accounts for a case fatality rate of 6.76\%. In Mexico, according to official statistics (April 18), 7,497 cases have been confirmed with 650 deaths, for a case fatality rate of 8.67\%. These estimates, however, may not reflect the final fatality risk among COVID-19 confirmed patients, because they are based on crosssectional counts of diagnosed and deceased patients, and therefore are not adjusted by time of exposure and right-censorship. In this paper we estimate fatality risks based on survival analysis methods, calculated from individual-level data on symptomatic patients confirmed with COVID-19 recently released by the Mexican Ministry of Health. The estimated fatality risk after 35 days of onset of symptoms is 12.38\% (95\% CI: 11.37-13.47). Fatality risks sharply rise with age, and significantly increase for males (59\%) and individuals with comorbidities (38\%-168\%, depending on the disease). Two reasons may explain the high COVID-19 related fatality risk observed in Mexico, despite its younger age structure: the high selectivity and self-selectivity in testing and the high prevalence of chronic-degenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Objective To characterize patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in a large New York City medical center and describe their clinical course across the emergency department, hospital wards, and intensive care units.
Design Retrospective manual medical record review.
Setting NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, a quaternary care academic medical center in New York City.
Participants The first 1000 consecutive patients with a positive result on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented to the emergency department or were admitted to hospital between 1 March and 5 April 2020. Patient data were manually abstracted from electronic medical records.
Main outcome measures Characterization of patients, including demographics, presenting symptoms, comorbidities on presentation, hospital course, time to intubation, complications, mortality, and disposition.
Results Of the first 1000 patients, 150 presented to the emergency department, 614 were admitted to hospital (not intensive care units), and 236 were admitted or transferred to intensive care units. The most common presenting symptoms were cough (732/1000), fever (728/1000), and dyspnea (631/1000). Patients in hospital, particularly those treated in intensive care units, often had baseline comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Patients admitted to intensive care units were older, predominantly male (158/236, 66.9\%), and had long lengths of stay (median 23 days, interquartile range 12-32 days); 78.0\% (184/236) developed acute kidney injury and 35.2\% (83/236) needed dialysis. Only 4.4\% (6/136) of patients who required mechanical ventilation were first intubated more than 14 days after symptom onset. Time to intubation from symptom onset had a bimodal distribution, with modes at three to four days, and at nine days. As of 30 April, 90 patients remained in hospital and 211 had died in hospital.
Conclusions Patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 at this medical center faced major morbidity and mortality, with high rates of acute kidney injury and inpatient dialysis, prolonged intubations, and a bimodal distribution of time to intubation from symptom onset.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: There is insufficient evidence to support clinical decision-making for cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 due to the lack of large studies. Methods: We used data from a single large UK Cancer Centre to assess demographic/clinical characteristics of 156 cancer patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis between 29 February-12 May 2020. Logistic/Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify which demographic and/or clinical characteristics were associated with COVID-19 severity/death. Results: 128 (82\%) presented with mild/moderate COVID-19 and 28 (18\%) with severe disease. Initial diagnosis of cancer \&gt;24m before COVID-19 (OR:1.74 (95\%CI: 0.71-4.26)), presenting with fever (6.21 (1.76-21.99)), dyspnoea (2.60 (1.00-6.76)), gastro-intestinal symptoms (7.38 (2.71-20.16)), or higher levels of CRP (9.43 (0.73-121.12)) were linked with greater COVID-19 severity. During median follow-up of 47d, 34 patients had died of COVID-19 (22\%). Asian ethnicity (3.73 (1.28-10.91), palliative treatment (5.74 (1.15-28.79), initial diagnosis of cancer \&gt;24m before (2.14 (1.04-4.44), dyspnoea (4.94 (1.99-12.25), and increased CRP levels (10.35 (1.05-52.21)) were positively associated with COVID-19 death. An inverse association was observed with increased levels of albumin (0.04 (0.01-0.04). Conclusions: A longer-established diagnosis of cancer was associated with increasing severity of infection as well as COVID-19 death, possibly reflecting effects of more advanced malignant disease impact on this infection. Asian ethnicity and palliative treatment were also associated with COVID-19 death in cancer patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Design and setting This is a retrospective, multi-center cohort study performed at twenty-four hospitals in Jiangsu, China. Participants From January 10 to March 15, 2020, 625 patients with COVID-19 were involved. Results Of the 625 patients (median age, 46 years; 329 [52.6\%] males), 37 (5.9\%) were children (18 years or less), 261 (40\%) young adults (19-44 years), 248 (39.7\%) middle-aged adults (45-64 years), and 79 (12.6\%) elderly (65 years or more). The incidence of hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes comorbidities increased with age (trend test, P \&lt; .0001, P = 0.0003, P \&lt; .0001, and P \&lt; .0001 respectively). Fever, cough, and shortness of breath occurred more commonly among older patients, especially the elderly, compared to children (Chi-square test, P = 0.0008, 0.0146, and 0.0282, respectively). The quadrant score and pulmonary opacity score increased with age (trend test, both P \&lt; .0001). Older patients had significantly more abnormal values in many laboratory parameters than younger patients. Elderly patients contributed the highest proportion of severe or critically-ill cases (33.0\%, Chi-square test P \&lt; 0.001), intensive care unit (ICU) (35.4\%, Chi-square test P \&lt; 0.001), and respiratory failure (31.6\%, Chi-square test P = 0.0266), and longest hospital stay (21 days, ANOVA-test P \&lt; 0.001). Conclusions Elderly (≥65) patients with COVID-19 had the highest risk of severe or critical illness, intensive care use, respiratory failure, and the longest hospital stay, which may be due partly to that they had higher incidence of comorbidities and poor immune responses to COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Since the first case of pneumonia was described, SARS-CoV-2 infection (coronavirus disease [COVID]-19) rapidly spread worldwide With 94,288 infections and more than 10,000 deaths, Mexico is the third Latin-American country in number of confirmed cases and second in mortality1. A major risk factor for adverse outcome in COVID-19 infection is the presence of advance age, co-morbidities including diabetes, hypertension and obesity among other non-communicable diseases2. Epidemiological data from high-prevalence countries reveal that compared to men, women are less likely to die or to require hospital admission to intensive care. This may suggest that pregnant women are not more susceptible to infection or to experience serious complications. However, whether the presence of co-morbidities or advanced maternal age confers a higher risk of adverse outcome in pregnant women with COVID-19 is unknown3. In this research letter, we aimed at evaluating the risk factor associated with maternal mortality secondary to COVID-19 infection in a middle-income country. Advanced maternal age is linked to an increased risk of mortality, while diabetes is the most important risk factor for maternal death. This is partly explained by an increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases in women of advanced age which is a common feature in most countries4. In the last decades, low- and middle-income countries have experienced accelerated socio-cultural changes associated with its incorporation into the international economic community, which have increased the number of obese and diabetic population, including pregnant women5. This has caused an increased risk for complications and fatality among COVID-19 positive population2,3. Thus, policies for reducing obesity and diabetes in low- and middle-income countries are most needed to reduce the mortality of COVID-19 in pregnant women.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}OBJECTIVE To examine if baseline soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) can predict whether patients with COVID-19 symptoms will need mechanical ventilation during a 14-day follow-up. Furthermore, to examine differences in demographics, clinical signs, and biomarkers in patients tested either positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2. DESIGN Prospective cohort study including patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19. SETTING Copenhagen University Hospital Amager and Hvidovre, Hvidovre, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS 407 patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 were included from the Emergency Department (ED). Patients were included from March 19 to April 3 and follow-up data was collected until April 17, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes were respiratory failure in patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19 and in those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, respectively. Furthermore, we analysed differences between patients testing positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, and disease severity outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients according to baseline suPAR. BACKGROUND Patients admitted to ED with clinical signs or symptoms of COVID-19 infection need a safe and quick triage, in order to determine if an in-hospital stay is necessary or if the patient can safely be isolated in their own home with relevant precautions. suPAR is a biomarker previously shown to be associated with adverse outcomes in acute medical patients. We aimed to examine if suPAR at baseline presentation is predictive of respiratory failure in patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19. Furthermore, we examined demographic, clinical, and biochemical differences between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative patients. RESULTS Among the 407 symptomatic patients, the median (interquartile range) age was 64 years (47-77), 58\% were women, and median suPAR was 4.2 ng/ml (2.7-6.4). suPAR level below 4.75 ng/ml at admission ruled out respiratory failure during follow-up with an area under the curve (95\% CI) of 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and a negative predictive value of 99.5\%. Of the 407 symptomatic patients, 117 (28.8\%) had a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 and presented with significant differences in vital signs, cell counts, and biomarkers compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. In SARS-CoV-2 positive patients eligible for mechanical ventilation (N=87), 26 (30\%) developed respiratory failure. Best baseline predictors of respiratory failure were suPAR with an area under the curve (95\% CI) of 0.88 (0.80-0.95), EWS 0.84 (0.75-0.93), lactate dehydrogenase 0.82 (0.71-0.93), and C-reactive protein 0.80 (0.70-0.89). CONCLUSION SARS-CoV-2 affects several patient parameters underpinning the severe impact of the infection. A low suPAR level (\&lt;4.75 ng/ml) at baseline is a useful biomarker for aiding clinical decisions including discharge of patients presenting with symptoms of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Stormy course has been reported among hospitalized adults with covid-19 in high- and middle-income countries. To assess clinical outcomes in consecutively hospitalized patients with mild covid-19 in India we performed a study. Methods: We developed a case registry of successive patients admitted with suspected covid-19 infection to our hospital (n=501). Covid-19 was diagnosed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Demographic, clinical, investigations details and outcomes were recorded. Descriptive statistics are presented. Results: Covid-19 was diagnosed in 234 (46.7\%) and data compared with 267 (53.3\%) negative controls. Mean age of covid-9 patients was 35.1+16.6y, 59.4\% were \&lt;40y and 64\% men. Symptoms were in less than 10\% and comorbidities were in 4-8\%. History of BCG vaccination was in 49\% cases vs 10\% controls. Cases compared to controls had significantly greater white cell (6.96+1.89 vs 6.12+1.69x109 cells/L) and lower lymphocyte count (1.98+0.79 vs 2.32+0.91x109 cells/L). No radiological and electrocardiographic abnormality was observed. All these were isolated or quarantined in the hospital and observed. Covid-19 patients received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin according to prevalent guidelines. One patient needed oxygen support while hospital course was uncomplicated in the rest. All were discharged alive. Conversion to virus negative status was in 10.2+6.4 days and was significantly lower in age \&gt;40y (9.1+5.2) compared to 40-59y (11.3+6.1) and \&gt;60y (16.4+13.3) (p=0.001). Conclusions: This hospital-based registry shows that mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic young covid-19 patients have excellent prognosis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Tocilizumab blocks pro-inflammatory activity of interleukin-6 (IL-6), involved in pathogenesis of pneumonia the most frequent cause of death in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A multicentre, single-arm, hypothesis-driven phase 2 trial was planned to study the effect of Tocilizumab on lethality rates at 14 and 30 days (co-primary endpoints). A cohort of patients consecutively enrolled after phase 2 was used as a validation dataset. A multivariable logistic regression was performed to generate hypotheses, while controlling for possible confounders. Results: out of 301 patients in phase 2 intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, 180 (59.8\%) received tocilizumab. With 67 death events, lethality rates were 18.4\% (97.5\%CI: 13.6-24.0, P=0.52) and 22.4\% (97.5\%CI: 17.2-28.3, P\&lt;0.001) at 14 and 30 days. Lethality rates were lower in the validation dataset, including 920 patients. No signal of specific drug toxicity was reported. The multivariable logistic regression suggests tocilizumab might be more effective in patients not requiring mechanical respiratory support at baseline. Also, it supports a positive effect on lethality rate of the use of corticosteroids. Conclusions: Tocilizumab reduced lethality rate at 30 days compared with null hypothesis, without significant toxicity. Such result support the use of tocilizumab while waiting for ongoing phase 3 trials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has resulted in over 100,000 deaths in the United States. Our institution has treated over 2,000 COVID-19 patients during the pandemic in New York City. The pandemic directly impacted cancer patients and the organization of cancer care. Mount Sinai Hospital has a large and diverse multiple myeloma (MM) population. Herein, we report the characteristics of COVID-19 infection and serological response in MM patients in a large tertiary care institution in New York. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 58 patients with a plasma-cell disorder (54 MM, 4 smoldering MM) who developed COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and April 30, 2020. We report epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics including persistence of viral detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, treatments initiated, and outcomes. Results: Of the 58 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 36 were hospitalized and 22 were managed at home. The median age was 67 years; 52\% of patients were male and 63\% were non-white. Hypertension (64\%), hyperlipidemia (62\%), obesity (37\%), diabetes mellitus (28\%), chronic kidney disease (24\%) and lung disease (21\%) were the most common comorbidities. In the total cohort, 14 patients (24\%) died. Older age (\&gt;70 years), male sex, cardiovascular risk, and patients not in complete remission (CR) or stringent CR were significantly (p\&lt;0.05) associated with hospitalization. Among hospitalized patients, laboratory findings demonstrated elevation of traditional inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer) and a significant (p\&lt;0.05) association between elevated inflammatory markers, severe hypogammaglobulinemia, non-white race, and mortality. Ninety-six percent (22/23) of patients developed antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 at a median of 32 days after initial diagnosis. Median time to PCR negativity was 43 (range 19-68) days from initial positive PCR. Conclusions: Drug exposure and MM disease status at the time of contracting COVID-19 had no bearing on mortality. Mounting a severe inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 and severe hypogammaglobulinemia were associated with higher mortality. The majority of patients mounted an antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. These findings pave a path to identification of vulnerable MM patients who need early intervention to improve outcome in future outbreaks of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for therapeutics and public health intervention strategies. Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of regulators of disease outcomes, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of the coronavirus proteome. To determine if conditions associated with dysregulation of the complement or coagulation systems impact adverse clinical outcomes, we performed a retrospective observational study of 11,116 patients who presented with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage) are risk factors for morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients - effects that could not be explained by age, sex, or history of smoking. Further, transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 650 control and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients demonstrated that in addition to innate Type-I interferon and IL-6 dependent inflammatory immune responses, infection results in robust engagement and activation of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, we conducted a candidate driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease. Among the findings, our scan identified putative complement and coagulation associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL variants of critical regulators of the complement and coagulation cascades. In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility. The results highlight the value of using a multi-modal analytical approach, combining molecular information from virus protein structure-function analysis with clinical informatics, transcriptomics, and genomics to reveal determinants and predictors of immunity, susceptibility, and clinical outcome associated with infection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalization and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalization and adverse outcome. \textbf{Results:} Overall, 236,439 patients were included, with 89,756 (38.0\%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23\% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8\% were hospitalized and 13.0\% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalization and adverse outcome. Current smoking was not associated with adverse outcome. \textbf{Conclusion:} This largest ever case series of COVID-19 patients identified risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization and adverse outcome. The findings could provide insight for the priorities the need to be set, especially by LMICs, to tackle the pandemic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives: To describe our experience with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak within a large rheumatology department, early in the pandemic. Methods: Symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers (HCWs) had a naso-oropharyngeal swab for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and were followed clinically. Reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) was repeated to document cure, and serological response was assessed. Patients with risk contacts within the department in the 14 days preceding the outbreak were screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Results: 14/34 HCWs (41\%; 40±14 years, 71\% female) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 11/34 (32\%) developed symptoms but were RT-PCR-negative. Half of RT-PCR-positive HCWs did not report fever, cough, or dyspnoea before testing, which were absent in 3/14 cases (21\%). Mild disease prevailed (79\%), but 3 HCWs had moderate disease requiring further assessment, which excluded severe complications. Nevertheless, symptom duration (28±18 days), viral shedding (31±10 days post-symptom onset, range 15-51) and work absence (29±28 days) were prolonged. 13/14 (93\%) of RT-PCR-positive and none of the RT-PCR-negative HCWs had a positive humoral response, with higher IgG-index in individuals over 50 years (14.5±7.7 vs 5.0±4.4, p=0.012). Of 617 rheumatic patients, 8 (1.3\%) developed COVID-19 symptoms (1/8 hospitalisation, 8/8 complete recovery), following a consultation/procedure with an asymptomatic (7/8) or mildly-symptomatic (1/8) HCW. Conclusions: A COVID-19 outbreak can occur among HCWs and rheumatic patients, swiftly spreading over the presymptomatic stage. Mild disease without typical symptoms should be recognised, and may evolve with delayed viral shedding, prolonged recovery, and adequate immune response in most individuals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background Clozapine, an antipsychotic with unique efficacy in treatment resistant psychosis, is associated with increased susceptibility to infection, including pneumonia. Aims To investigate associations between clozapine treatment and increased risk of COVID-19 in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who are receiving antipsychotic medications, using electronic health records data, in a geographically defined population in London. Method Using information from South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM) clinical records, via the Clinical Record Interactive Search system, we identified 6,309 individuals who had an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and were taking antipsychotics at the time on the COVID-19 pandemic onset in the UK. People who were on clozapine treatment were compared with those on any other antipsychotic treatment for risk of contracting COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 May 2020. We tested associations between clozapine treatment and COVID-19 infection, adjusting for gender, age, ethnicity, BMI, smoking status, and SLAM service use. Results Of 6,309 patients, 102 tested positive for COVID-19. Individuals who were on clozapine had increased risk of COVID-19 compared with those who were on other antipsychotic medication (unadjusted HR = 2.62 (95\% CI 1.73 - 3.96), which was attenuated after adjusting for potential confounders, including clinical contact (adjusted hazard ratio HR=1.76, 95\% CI 1.14 - 2.72). Conclusions These findings provide support for the hypothesis that clozapine treatment is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19. Further research will be needed in other samples to confirm this association. Potential clinical implications are discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objective To characterise the clinical features of patients admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the United Kingdom during the growth phase of the first wave of this outbreak who were enrolled in the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study, and to explore risk factors associated with mortality in hospital.
Design Prospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering and near real time analysis.
Setting 208 acute care hospitals in England, Wales, and Scotland between 6 February and 19 April 2020. A case report form developed by ISARIC and WHO was used to collect clinical data. A minimal follow-up time of two weeks (to 3 May 2020) allowed most patients to complete their hospital admission.
Participants 20 133 hospital inpatients with covid-19.
Main outcome measures Admission to critical care (high dependency unit or intensive care unit) and mortality in hospital.
Results The median age of patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, or with a diagnosis of covid-19 made in hospital, was 73 years (interquartile range 58-82, range 0-104). More men were admitted than women (men 60\%, n=12 068; women 40\%, n=8065). The median duration of symptoms before admission was 4 days (interquartile range 1-8). The commonest comorbidities were chronic cardiac disease (31\%, 5469/17 702), uncomplicated diabetes (21\%, 3650/17 599), non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease (18\%, 3128/17 634), and chronic kidney disease (16\%, 2830/17 506); 23\% (4161/18 525) had no reported major comorbidity. Overall, 41\% (8199/20 133) of patients were discharged alive, 26\% (5165/20 133) died, and 34\% (6769/20 133) continued to receive care at the reporting date. 17\% (3001/18 183) required admission to high dependency or intensive care units; of these, 28\% (826/3001) were discharged alive, 32\% (958/3001) died, and 41\% (1217/3001) continued to receive care at the reporting date. Of those receiving mechanical ventilation, 17\% (276/1658) were discharged alive, 37\% (618/1658) died, and 46\% (764/1658) remained in hospital. Increasing age, male sex, and comorbidities including chronic cardiac disease, non-asthmatic chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, liver disease and obesity were associated with higher mortality in hospital.
Conclusions ISARIC WHO CCP-UK is a large prospective cohort study of patients in hospital with covid-19. The study continues to enrol at the time of this report. In study participants, mortality was high, independent risk factors were increasing age, male sex, and chronic comorbidity, including obesity. This study has shown the importance of pandemic preparedness and the need to maintain readiness to launch research studies in response to outbreaks.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Risk factors for poor outcomes from COVID-19 are emerging among US cohorts, but patient trajectories during hospitalization ranging from mild-moderate, severe, and death and the factors associated with these outcomes have been underexplored. Methods: We performed a cohort analysis of consecutive COVID-19 hospital admissions at 5 Johns Hopkins hospitals in the Baltimore/DC area between March 4 and April 24, 2020. Disease severity and outcomes were classified using the WHO COVID-19 disease severity ordinal scale. Cox proportional-hazards regressions were performed to assess relationships between demographics, clinical features and progression to severe disease or death. Results: 832 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized; 633 (76.1\%) were discharged, 113 (13.6\%) died, and 85 (10.2\%) remained hospitalized. Among those discharged, 518 (82\%) had mild/moderate and 116 (18\%) had severe illness. Mortality was statistically significantly associated with increasing age per 10 years (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.54; 95\%CI 1.28-1.84), nursing home residence (aHR 2.13, 95\%CI 1.41-3.23), Charlson comorbidity index (1.13; 95\% CI 1.02-1.26), respiratory rate (aHR 1.13; 95\%CI 1.09-1.17), D-dimer greater than 1mg/dL (aHR 2.79; 95\% 1.53-5.09), and detectable troponin (aHR 2.79; 95\%CI 1.53-5.09). In patients under 60, only male sex (aHR 1.7;95\%CI 1.11-2.58), increasing body mass index (BMI) (aHR1.25 1.14-1.37), Charlson score (aHR 1.27; 1.1-1.46) and respiratory rate (aHR 1.16; 95\%CI 1.13-1.2) were associated with severe illness or death. Conclusions: A combination of demographic and clinical features on admission is strongly associated with progression to severe disease or death in a US cohort of COVID-19 patients. Younger patients have distinct risk factors for poor outcomes. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract Invasive mechanical has been associated with high mortality in COVID-19. Alternative therapy of High flow nasal therapy (HFNT) has been greatly debated around the world for use in COVID-19 pandemic due to concern for increased healthcare worker transmission. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from March 10, 2020, to April 24, 2020 with moderate to severe respiratory failure treated with High Flow nasal therapy (HFNT). Primary outcome was prevention of intubation. Results Of the 445 patients with COVID-19, 104 met our inclusion criteria. The average age was 60.66 (+13.50) years, 49 (47.12 \%) were female, 53 (50.96\%) were African American, 23 (22.12\%) Hispanic. Forty-three patients (43.43\%) were smokers. SF and chest Xray scores had a statistically significant improvement from day 1 to day 7. 67 of 104 (64.42\%) were able to avoid invasive mechanical ventilation in our cohort. Incidence of hospital/ventilator associated pneumonia was 2.9\%. Overall, mortality was 14.44\% (n=15) in our cohort with 13 (34.4\%) in the progressed to intubation group and 2 (2.9\%) in the non-intubation group. Mortality and incidence of VAP/HAP was statistically higher in the progressed to intubation group. Conclusion HFNT use is associated with a reduction in the rate of Invasive mechanical ventilation and overall mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, hospitals in developing countries often cannot measure some of the variables that have been reported as useful. - Objective: To assess the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the novel LOW-HARM score (Lymphopenia, Oxygen saturation, White blood cells, Hypertension, Age, Renal injury, and Myocardial injury). - Design: Demographic and clinical data from patients with known clinical outcomes (death or discharge) was obtained. Patients were grouped according to their outcome. The LOW-HARM score was calculated for each patient and its distribution, potential cut-off values and demographic data were compared. - Setting: Twelve hospitals in ten different cities in Mexico. - Participants: Data from 438 patients was collected. A total of 400 (200 per group) was included in the analysis. - Exposure: All patients had an infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR. - Main Outcome: The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of different cut-offs of the LOW-HARM score to predict death. - Results: Mean scores at admission and their distributions were significantly lower in patients who were discharged compared to those who died during their hospitalization 10 (SD: 17) vs 70 (SD: 28). The overall AUC of the model was 95\%. A cut-off \&gt; 65 points had a specificity of 98\% and a positive predictive value of 96\%. More than a third of the cases (36\%) in the sample had a LOW-HARM score \&gt; 65 points. - Conclusions and relevance: The LOW-HARM score measured at admission is highly specific and useful for predicting mortality. It is easy to calculate and can be updated with individual clinical progression.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 have only recently been described, with a paucity of literature reporting the potential relationship between COVID-19 and acute symptomatic seizures. Two prior studies found no clinical or electrographic seizures in their cohorts of COVID-19 patients with altered mental status (AMS) and clinical seizure-like events (SLEs). Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 22 critically-ill COVID-19 patients above the age of 18 years who underwent EEG (electroencephalography) monitoring between April 20th, 2020 and May 20th, 2020 were studied. 19 patients underwent continuous EEG (cEEG) for at least 24 hours, and 3 patients underwent routine EEGs (\&lt;1 hour). Demographics including age, gender, comorbid medical, and neurological conditions were collected. Clinical variables included EEG findings, anti-seizure medications, discharge disposition, and survival. Findings: 17 patients underwent EEG monitoring for unexplained altered mental status changes and 5 patients underwent monitoring for a seizure-like event. 5 patients had epileptiform abnormalities on EEG (4 patients on cEEG, 1 on routine EEG); and only 2 of 5 epileptic EEG patients had a prior history of epilepsy. 2 patients in our cohort had electrographic seizures in the absence of prior epilepsy history. No patients with epileptiform abnormalities or electrographic seizures had acutely abnormal neuroimaging on CT or MRI. Interpretation: Encephalopathic COVID-19 positive patients had a range of EEG abnormalities, and a higher proportion of patients in this series had electrographic seizures than previous literature suggests. This may be influenced by the duration of monitoring with cEEG and the use of a 21 channel electrode system. cEEG findings may help to guide antiseizure medical therapy, as well as the workup of altered mental status in the setting of unremarkable neuroimaging. Funding: No funding was used for this study.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Importance: Multiple sclerosis patients have been considered a higher-risk population for COVID-19 due to the high prevalence of disability and disease-modifying therapy use; however, no study has identified clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of multiple sclerosis, including staging, degree of disability, and disease-modifying therapy use that are associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19. Design: Prospective cohort study looking at the outcomes of multiple sclerosis patients with COVID-19 between March 1st and May 18th, 2020. Setting: This is a multicenter study of three distinct hospital systems within the U.S. Participants: The study included 40 consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection. Exposures: Multiple sclerosis staging, severe disability (based on baseline-extended disability status scale equal to or greater than 6.0) and disease-modifying therapy. Main Outcomes and Measure: Severity of COVID-19 infection was based on hospital course, where a mild course was defined as the patient not requiring hospital admission, moderate severity was defined as the patient requiring hospital admission to the general floor only, and most severe was defined as requiring intensive care unit admission and/or death. Results: For the 40 patients, the median age was 52(45.5-61) years, 16/40(40\%) were male, and 21/40(52.5\%) were African American. 19/40(47.5\%) had mild courses, 15/40(37.5\%) had moderate courses, and 6/40(15\%) had severe courses. Patients with moderate and severe courses were significantly older than those with a mild course (57[50-63] years old and 66[58.8-69.5] years old vs 48[40-51.5] years old, P=0.0121, P=0.0373). There was differing prevalence of progressive multiple sclerosis staging in those with more severe courses (severe:2/6[33.3\%]primary-progressing and 0/6[0\%]secondary-progressing, moderate:1/14[7.14\%] and 5/14[35.7\%] vs mild:0/19[0\%] and 1/19[5.26\%], P=0.0075, 1 unknown). Significant disability was found in 1/19(5.26\%) mild course-patients, but was in 9/15(60\%, P=0.00435) of moderate course-patients and 2/6(33.3\%, P=0.200) of severe course-patients. Disease-modifying therapy prevalence did not differ among courses (mild:17/19[89.5\%], moderate:12/15[80\%] and severe:3/6[50\%], P=0.123). Conclusions and Relevance: Multiple sclerosis patients with more severe COVID-19 courses tended to be older, were more likely to suffer from progressive staging, and had a higher degree of disability. However, disease-modifying therapy use was not different among courses.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Early studies of patients with COVID-19 have demonstrated markedly dysregulated coagulation and a high risk of morbid arterial and venous thrombotic events. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described in patients with COVID-19, their potential role in COVID-19-associated thrombosis remains unknown. Objectives: To elucidate the potential role of hyperactive neutrophils and NET release in COVID-19-associated thrombosis. Patients/Methods: This is a retrospective, case-control study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who developed thrombosis (n=11), as compared with gender- and age-matched COVID-19 patients without clinical thrombosis (n=33). In addition to capturing clinical data, we measured remnants of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, and citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in patient sera. Results: The majority of patients (9/11) were receiving at least prophylactic doses of heparinoids at the time thrombosis was diagnosed. As compared with controls, patients with COVID-19-associated thrombosis had significantly higher blood levels of markers of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil activation (calprotectin). The thrombosis group also had higher levels of D-dimer, CRP, ferritin, and platelets, but not troponin or neutrophils. Finally, there were strong associations between markers of hyperactive neutrophils (calprotectin and cell-free DNA) and D-dimer. Conclusion: Elevated levels of neutrophil activation and NET formation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are associated with higher risk of morbid thrombotic complications. These observations underscore the need for urgent investigation into the potential relationship between NETs and unrelenting thrombosis in COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The COVID-19 pandemic caused by infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 100,000 deaths in the United States. Several studies have revealed that the hyper-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 is a major cause of disease severity and death in infected patients. However, predictive biomarkers of pathogenic inflammation to help guide targetable immune pathways are critically lacking. We implemented a rapid multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β in hospitalized COVID-19 patients upon admission to the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. Patients (n=1484) were followed up to 41 days (median 8 days) and clinical information, laboratory test results and patient outcomes were collected. In 244 patients, cytokine measurements were repeated over time, and effect of drugs could be assessed. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare survival by cytokine strata, followed by Cox regression models to evaluate the independent predictive value of baseline cytokines. We found that high serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α levels at the time of hospitalization were strong and independent predictors of patient survival. Importantly, when adjusting for disease severity score, common laboratory inflammation markers, hypoxia and other vitals, demographics, and a range of comorbidities, IL-6 and TNF-α serum levels remained independent and significant predictors of disease severity and death. We propose that serum IL-6 and TNF-α levels should be considered in the management and treatment of COVID-19 patients to stratify prospective clinical trials, guide resource allocation and inform therapeutic options. We also propose that patients with high IL-6 and TNF-α levels should be assessed for combinatorial blockade of pathogenic inflammation in this disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND Smokers are generally more susceptible to infectious respiratory diseases and are at higher risk of developing severe complications from these infections. Conflicting reports exist regarding the impact of smoking on the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS We carried out a population-based study among over 3,000,000 adult members of Clalit Health Services, the largest health provider in Israel. Since the beginning of the disease outbreak, 114,545 individuals underwent RT-PCR testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and 4.0\% had positive results. We performed a case-control study among patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, to assess the impact of smoking on infection incidence and severity. Individuals with positive tests were matched in a 1:5 ratio to individuals tested negative, of the same sex, age, and ethnicity/religion. Conditional logistic regressions were performed to evaluate odds ratios for current and previous smoking on the risk of testing positive. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed among patients infected with COVID-19 to estimate the association between smoking and fatal or severe disease requiring ventilation. Regressions were performed with and without adjustment for preexisting medical conditions. RESULTS In the matched cohort, current smokers (9.8\%) were significantly less prevalent among members tested positive compared to the general population, and to matched members tested negative (19.4\%, P\&lt;0.001). Current smoking was associated with significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) for testing positive OR=0.457 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.407-0.514). Among patients tested positive, there was no evidence of significantly increased risk of developing severe or fatal disease. CONCLUSION The risk of infection by COVID-19 appears to be reduced by half among current smokers. This intriguing finding may reveal unique infection mechanisms present for COVID-19 which may be targeted to combat the disease and reduce its infection rate.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective: To examine the association of a range of psychosocial factors with hospitalisation for COVID-19. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: England. Participants: UK Biobank comprises around half a million people who were aged 40 to 69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when information on psychosocial factors and covariates were captured. Main outcome measure: Hospitalisation for COVID-19 in England between 16th March and 26th April 2020 as provided by Public Health England. Results: There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 people. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95\% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function: verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51). These associations were graded (p-value for trend \&lt;=0.038) such that effects were apparent across the full psychosocial continua. After mutual adjustment for these characteristics plus ethnicity, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, only the relationship between lower cognitive function as measured using the reasoning test and a doubling in the risk of the infection remained (1.98; 1.38, 2.85). Conclusion: A range of psychosocial factors revealed associations with hospitalisations for COVID-19 of which the relation with cognitive function was most robust to statistical adjustment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objectives COVID-19 outcomes in people with rheumatic diseases remain poorly understood. The aim was to examine demographic and clinical factors associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation status in people with rheumatic disease.
Methods Case series of individuals with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry: 24 March 2020 to 20 April 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95\% CIs of hospitalisation. Age, sex, smoking status, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities and rheumatic disease medications taken immediately prior to infection were analysed.
Results A total of 600 cases from 40 countries were included. Nearly half of the cases were hospitalised (277, 46\%) and 55 (9\%) died. In multivariable-adjusted models, prednisone dose ≥10 mg/day was associated with higher odds of hospitalisation (OR 2.05, 95\% CI 1.06 to 3.96). Use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) alone or in combination with biologics/Janus Kinase inhibitors was not associated with hospitalisation (OR 1.23, 95\% CI 0.70 to 2.17 and OR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.37 to 1.46, respectively). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was not associated with hospitalisation status (OR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.39 to 1.06). Tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (anti-TNF) use was associated with a reduced odds of hospitalisation (OR 0.40, 95\% CI 0.19 to 0.81), while no association with antimalarial use (OR 0.94, 95\% CI 0.57 to 1.57) was observed.
Conclusions We found that glucocorticoid exposure of ≥10 mg/day is associated with a higher odds of hospitalisation and anti-TNF with a decreased odds of hospitalisation in patients with rheumatic disease. Neither exposure to DMARDs nor NSAIDs were associated with increased odds of hospitalisation.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective. During the onset of a novel epidemic, there are public health priorities that need to be estimated, such as risk factors for infection, hospitalization, and clinical severity to allocate resources and issue health policies. In this work we calculate the risk of infection and hospitalization by Covid-19 conferred by demographic, lifestyle, and co-morbidity factors. Material and methods. This is a case-control study including the tested individuals for SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR officially reported by the Health Secretary of Mexico from January 01 to May 8, 2020 (102,875 subjects). Demographic (sex, age, foreign and immigrant status, native speaking, place of residence), life-style (smoking), and co-morbidities [diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure (HBP), asthma, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease other than HBP, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other not specified diseases (other diseases)] variables were included in this study. The risk of infection and hospitalization conferred by each variable was calculated with univariate (ULR) and multivariate (MLR) logistic regression models. Results. The place of residence (OR=4.91 living in Tijuana City), followed by advanced age (OR=6.71 in 61-70 years-old), suffering from diabetes (OR=1.87) or obesity (OR=1.61), being male (OR=1.55), having HBP (OR=1.52), and notoriously being indigenous (OR=1.49) conferred a higher risk of becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2 in Mexico. Unexpectedly, we found that having asthma (OR=0.63), immunosuppression (OR=0.65) or smoking (OR=0.85) are protective factors against infection, while suffering from COPD does not increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, advanced age (OR=11.6 in ≥ 70 years-old) is the main factor for hospitalization due to Covid-19, followed by some co-morbidities, mainly diabetes (OR=3.69) and HBP (OR=2.79), being indigenous (OR=1.89), male sex (OR=1.67) and the place of residence (OR=4.22 for living in Juarez City). Unlike the protective risk against infection, immunosuppression (OR=2.69) and COPD (OR=3.63), contribute to the risk of being hospitalized, while having asthma (OR=0.7) also provides protection against hospitalization. Conclusions. In addition to confirming that older age, diabetes, HBP and obesity are the main risk of infection and hospitalization by Covid-19, we found that being indigenous, immunosuppression, smoking and asthma protect against infection, and the latter also against hospitalization.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract BACKGROUND The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Saudi Arabia was first identified in a traveler from Al Qatif city, on March 2nd, 2020. The disease has quickly spread and reached multiple cities within a few weeks. In an attempt to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, the government has implemented strict regulations. Starting March 15th, all travelers coming back to the kingdom were tested for COVID-19 and were quarantined in a government-designated facility. The same rule was applied to all positive cases identified by contact tracing. In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers, epidemiological characteristics, clinical presentations, and viral clearance of SARS-COV-2 positive quarantined individuals in a quarantine facility in the eastern province. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study on 128 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 subjects who were quarantined in a government-designated facility. The study period was from March 16th until April 18th, 2020. We collected data on demographics and on clinical symptoms. Also, samples for PCR tests were collected upon admission and were repeated every 72 hours if they were still positive. All negative samples were repeated within 24 hours for confirmation. RESULTS Sixty-nine of the 128 residents (54\%) were completely asymptomatic until the end of the study. The remaining 59 residents (46\%) had only mild symptoms. The most common symptom was a sudden loss of smell and taste, accounting for 47.5\%. The median time to virus clearance was significantly different between the two groups. Symptomatic residents cleared the virus at a median of 17 days (95\% CI,12.4-21.6) from the first positive PCR vs. 11days (95\% CI, 8.7-13.3) in the asymptomatic group (P=0.011). False-negative test results occurred in 18.8\% of the total residents and false-positive results in 3\%. CONCLUSION The prevalence of asymptomatic carriers is high in our study. Testing, and isolating travelers and contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases, regardless of symptoms, were very effective measures for early disease identification and containment. Loss of taste and smell was the most common presentation in our mild symptomatic residents, and it might be predictive of mild disease. The persistent positive PCRs observed in the mild asymptomatic residents despite being symptoms free, warrant further studies to determine its implications on disease spread and control.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}OBJECTIVES: To describe patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) who had COVID-19; to compare patients who need hospital admission versus those that did not and assess risk factors of hospital admission related to COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study, from 1st March 2020 until the 24th of April. All patients being attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital of Madrid, with medical diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disease, and with symptomatic COVID-19 disease were included. Main variable was the hospital admission related to COVID-19. Covariates: sociodemographic, clinical and treatments. We performed a multivariate logistic regression model to assess risk factors of hospital admission. RESULTS: 123 patients with IRD and COVID-19 disease were identified and included. We found 54 patients that need hospital admission, 59.2\% were women, with a mean age at hospital admission of 69.7 (15.7) years, and a median lag time from symptoms onset to hospital admission of 5 (3-10) days. The median length of stay was 9 (6-14) days. A total of 12 patients died (22\%) during their hospital admission. Factors independently associated with hospital admission were being older (OR 1.08; p=0.00), and type of diagnosis (OR 3.55; p=0.01), compared to those who were ambulatory. DMARDs dropped from the model. Male sex, associated comorbidities and glucocorticoids use showed a tendency risk (p\&lt;0.2) CONCLUSION: Our results suggests that age, comorbidities and having an autoimmune systemic condition increased the risk of hospital admission, whereas disease modifying agents were not associated with hospital admission.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract Background: Concerns have emerged about the higher risk of fatal COVID-19 in cancer patients. In this paper, we review the experience of a comprehensive cancer center. Methods: A prospective registry was set up at Institut Curie at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. All cancer patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 were entered and actively followed for 28 days. Results: Among 9,842 patients treated at Institut Curie between mid-March and early May 2020, 141 (1.4\%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on RT-PCR testing and/or CT-scan. In line with our case-mix, breast cancer (40\%) was the most common tumor type, followed by hematological and lung malignancies (both 13\%). Patients with active cancer therapy or/and advanced cancer accounted for 88\% and 69\% of patients, respectively. At diagnosis, 79\% of patients had COVID-19 related symptoms, with an extent of lung parenchyma involvement ≤50\% in 90\% of patients. Blood count variations and C-reactive protein elevation were the most common laboratory abnormalities. Antibiotics and antiviral agents were administered in 48\% and 7\% of patients, respectively. At the time of analysis, 26 patients (18\%) have died from COVID-19, and 81 (57\%) were cured. Independent prognostic factors at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis associated with death or intensive care unit admission were extent of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased O2 saturation. Conclusions: COVID-19 incidence and presentation in cancer patients appear to be very similar to those in the general population. The outcome of COVID-19 is primarily driven by the initial severity of infection rather than patient or cancer characteristics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Design In this case series of 15 survivors and 16 non-survivors, data from admission to discharge was collected and aligned to lowest PaO2/FiO2 ratio where aggregation and trends were demonstrated. Setting Single centre case-series in London, Intensive Care. Participants All non-survivors were included (n=16). A biased set of survivors (n=15) who were demonstrated an unexpected and rapid recovery after a prolonged period of mechanical ventilatory support. Results Respiratory failure trajectories of survivors and non-survivors were similar once aligned indicating, from a respiratory function perspective, it is difficult to identify survivors from non-survivors with some survivors improving late in their disease (day 20 - 30 from symptom onset) Non-survivors are admitted earlier in their disease (p \&lt; 0.05) and had worse organ failure requirements prior to the nadir of their respiratory funciton (p \&lt; 0.05) compard to survivors. Conclusion Analysis of multiple factors fails to differentiate between survivors and non-survivors. Even when faced with multiorgan failure, perseverance until discharge must be advocated as late improvements do occur in survivors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}\textbf{Background} Anti-inflammatory therapies such as IL-6 inhibition have been proposed for COVID-19 in a vacuum of evidence-based treatment. However, abrogating the inflammatory response in infectious diseases may impair a desired host response and predispose to secondary infections. \textbf{Methods} We retrospectively reviewed the medical record of critically ill COVID-19 patients during an 8-week span and compared the prevalence of secondary infection and outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Additionally, we included representative histopathologic post-mortem findings from several COVID-19 cases that underwent autopsy at our institution. \textbf{Results} 111 patients were identified, of which 48 had received tocilizumab while 63 had not. Receiving tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of secondary bacterial (50\% vs. 28.6\%, p=0.021 and fungal (8.3\% vs. 0\%, p=0.078) infections. Consistent with higher number of infections, patients who received tocilizumab had higher mortality (39.6 vs. 17.4\%, p=0.016). Seven cases underwent autopsy. In 3 cases who received tocilizumab, there was evidence of pneumonia on pathology. Of the 4 cases that had not been given tocilizumab, 2 showed evidence of aspiration pneumonia and 2 exhibited diffuse alveolar damage. \textbf{Conclusions} Experimental therapies are currently being applied to COVID-19 outside of clinical trials. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as anti-IL-6 therapy have the potential to impair viral clearance, predispose to secondary infection, and cause harm. We seek to raise physician awareness of these issues and highlight the need to better understand the immune response in COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract Background The outbreak of COVID-19 has aroused global concerns. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 nonsurvivors and analyze possible causes for the rapid disease progress to death. Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 died in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University before February 15, 2020, were identified. We obtained epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data from electronic medical records. Results Among 101 nonsurvivors, the median age was 71.0 years (IQR, 59.0-80.0), 59.4\% were male, 79.2\% had one or more comorbidities including hypertension (58.4\%), cardiovascular disease (22.8\%), diabetes (20.8\%) etc. The most common symptoms were fever (76.2\%), cough (58.4\%) and dyspnea (54.5\%). Respiratory failure (99.0\%), acute cardiac injury (52.5\%), sepsis (40.6\%) and acute kidney injury (23.8\%) were most common complications. Compared with patients died after 3 days of admission, patients died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher white blood cell count (10.8 vs 6.7*109/L, P=0.001) and neutrophil count (8.9 vs 5.5*109/L, P=0.001), longer prothrombin time (13.2 vs 12.5 s, P=0.040), higher D-dimer concentration (7.64 vs 2.82, P=0.040), higher lactate level (2.9 vs 2.2 mmol/L, P=0.042), lower oxygen saturation (85.0\% vs 91.0\%, P=0.008), and were more likely to suffer sepsis (52.1\% vs 30.2\%, P=0.025). Conclusions Older patients with underlying comorbidities suffering COVID-19 were at high risk of death. Respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury played crucial roles in the death of COVID-19 patients. Early development of sepsis was associated with the rapid disease progress to death.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The association between current tobacco smoking, the risk of developing COVID-19 and the severity of illness is an important information gap. Methods: UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app provided baseline data including demographics, anthropometrics, smoking status and medical conditions, were asked to log symptoms daily from 24th March 2020 to 23rd April 2020. Participants reporting that they did not feel physically normal were taken through a series of questions, including 14 potential COVID-19 symptoms and any hospital attendance. The main study outcome was the association between current smoking and the development of classic symptoms of COVID-19 during the pandemic defined as fever, new persistent cough and breathlessness. The number of concurrent COVID-19 symptoms was used as a proxy for severity. In addition, association of subcutaneous adipose tissue expression of ACE2, both the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and a potential mediator of disease severity, with smoking status was assessed in a subset of 541 twins from the TwinsUK cohort. Results: Data were available on 2,401,982 participants, mean(SD) age 43.6(15.1) years, 63.3\% female, overall smoking prevalence 11.0\%. 834,437 (35\%) participants reported being unwell and entered one or more symptoms. Current smokers were more likely to develop symptoms suggesting a diagnosis of COVID-19; classic symptoms adjusted OR[95\%CI] 1.14[1.10 to 1.18]; \&gt;5 symptoms 1.29[1.26 to 1.31]; \&gt;10 symptoms 1.50[1.42 to 1.58]. Smoking was associated with reduced ACE2 expression in adipose tissue (Beta(SE)= -0.395(0.149); p=7.01x10-3). Interpretation: These data are consistent with smokers having an increased risk from COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: COVID-19 induces progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome, mostly due to a dysregulated inflammatory response. Since the first observations of COVID-19 patients, significant hypoalbuminemia was detected. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that hypoalbuminemia in COVID-19 patients is due to pulmonary capillary leakage and to test its correlation with indicators of respiratory function. Methods: 174 COVID-19 patients, 92 admitted to the Intermediate Medicine ward (IMW), and 82 to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan were included in this study. Findings: Serum albumin concentration was decreased in the whole cohort, with ICU patients displaying lower values than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g/L, p\&lt;0.0001]. Lower albumin values were found in patients belonging to a more compromised group (lower PaO2 to FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings). In a subset of 26 patients, analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) highlighted high protein concentrations, which were correlated to Interleukin-8 and Interleukin-10 BALF concentration. The length of hospitalisation [20 (15-29) vs 8 (5-14) days, p\&lt;0.0001] and death rate (52.4\% vs 21.7\%, p\&lt;0.0001) were higher in ICU than in IMW patients, while a strict relation between hypoalbuminemia and 30 day-survival was detected in the whole cohort. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten autopsy lung tissues showed diffuse loosening of interendothelial junctional complex. Interpretation: The degree of hypoalbuminemia can be considered as a useful severity marker in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Pulmonary capillary leak syndrome secondary to the hyperinflammatory state plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 respiratory dysfunction and should be regarded as a therapeutic target.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Objective: To describe risk factors for severe outcomes among adults hospitalized with COVID-19. Design: Cohort study of patients identified through the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network. Setting: 154 acute care hospitals in 74 counties in 13 states. Patients: 2491 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during March 1-May 2, 2020. Measurements: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions. Results: Ninety-two percent of patients had at least 1 underlying condition; 32\% required intensive care unit (ICU) admission; 19\% invasive mechanical ventilation; 15\% vasopressors; and 17\% died during hospitalization. Independent factors associated with ICU admission included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ years versus 18-39 years (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.53, 1.65, 1.84 and 1.43, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.34); obesity (aRR 1.31); immunosuppression (aRR 1.29); and diabetes (aRR 1.13). Independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality included ages 50-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ years versus 18-39 years (aRR 3.11, 5.77, 7.67 and 10.98, respectively); male sex (aRR 1.30); immunosuppression (aRR 1.39); renal disease (aRR 1.33); chronic lung disease (aRR 1.31); cardiovascular disease (aRR 1.28); neurologic disorders (aRR 1.25); and diabetes (aRR 1.19). Race/ethnicity was not associated with either ICU admission or death. Limitation: Data were limited to patients who were discharged or died in-hospital and had complete chart abstractions; patients who were still hospitalized or did not have accessible medical records were excluded. Conclusion: In-hospital mortality for COVID-19 increased markedly with increasing age. These data help to characterize persons at highest risk for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes and define target groups for prevention and treatment strategies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background. COVID-19 pandemic poses a burden on hospital resources and intensive care unit (ICU) occupation. This study aimed to provide a scoring system that, assessed upon first-contact evaluation at the emergency department, predicts the need for ICU admission. Methods. We prospectively assessed patients admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City between March 16th and May 21st, and split them into development and validation cohorts. Patients were segregated into a group that required admission to ICU, and a group that never required ICU admission and was discharged from hospitalization. By logistic regression, we constructed predictive models for ICU admission, including clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings from the emergency department evaluation. The ABC-GOALS score was created by assigning values to the weighted odd ratios. The score was compared to other COVID-19 and pneumonia scores through the area under the curve (AUC). Results. We included 569 patients divided into development (n=329) and validation (n=240) cohorts. One-hundred-fifteen patients from each cohort required admission to ICU. The clinical model (ABC-GOALSc) included sex, obesity, the Charlson comorbidity index, dyspnea, arterial pressure, and respiratory rate at triage evaluation. The clinical plus laboratory model (ABC-GOALScl) added serum albumin, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase, and S/F ratio to the clinical model. The model that included imaging (ABC-GOALSclx) added the CT scan finding of \&gt;50\% lung involvement. The model AUC were 0.79 (95\%CI 0.74-0.83) and 0.77 (95\%CI 0.71-0.83), 0.86 (95\%CI 0.82-0.90) and 0.87 (95\%CI 0.83-0.92), 0.88 (95\%CI 0.84-0.92) and 0.86 (95\%CI 0.81-0.90) for the clinical, laboratory and imaging models in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The ABC-GOALScl and ABC-GOALSclx scores outperformed other COVID-19 and pneumonia-specific scores. Conclusion. The ABC-GOALS score is a tool to evaluate patients with COVID-19 at admission to the emergency department, which allows to timely predict their risk of admission to an ICU.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background and Aims: The abnormal liver function and even liver failure related death were reported in the COVID-19 patients, but less of studies focus on the dynamic liver function changes. We analysed the liver function indexes of COVID-19 patients to explore the characteristics of liver function changes in patients with different severity. Methods: This study included 54 moderate, 50 severe, and 31 death nucleic acid-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the central hospital of Wuhan, China. Epidemiological histories, clinical features, imaging materials, medications and especially major liver function laboratory tests were collected for analysis. Results: The clinical symptoms did not present any significant difference in the patients at admission, but the older male patients had pronounced mortality risk. The normal ratio of ALT, TB, and DBIL of moderate patients was 96.3\%, 94.44\%, and 98.15\% separately at the first test, but 59.26\% of patients showed declined ALB levels. The normal ratio of all liver function indexes declined after admission, but most abnormalities were mild (1-2 times of upper limit unit) and went back normal before discharge. In severe patients, the normal ratio of ALB dropped down to 30.61\% at admission along with the dramatic impaired normal ratio of bilirubin at the second test. The severe patients liver function dysfunction was worse than the moderate patients but without a significant difference. The dead patients showed a significantly higher level of DBIL, AST, GGT and CRP than other groups patients in the final test, along with the hypoalbuminemia. What is worse, 16.13\% of non-survivors were diagnosed with liver failure. No medication was found to be related to ALT, AST, and GGT abnormality in our study. Conclusion: In moderate and severe patients, liver dysfunction was mild. Patients widely presented lower level of ALB. The higher level of bilirubin, AST, and GGT was likely to indicate the worse outcome. Dynamic monitoring of liver function indexes could be considered and liver failure related death should be noticed and prevented in the early stage.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Some patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the recent pandemic have required critical care, becoming one of the main limitations of the health systems. Our objective has been to identify potential markers at admission predicting the need for critical care in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia Methods: We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from electronic medical records of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection by real-time RT-PCR. A comparison was made between patients staying in the hospitalization ward with those who required critical care. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods were used to identify risk factors predicting critical care need Findings: Between March 15 and April 15, 2020, 150 patients under the age of 75 were selected (all with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-19 infection), 75 patients requiring intensive care assistance and 75 remaining the regular hospitalization ward. Most patients requiring critical care were males, 76\% compared with 60\% in the non-critical care group (p\&lt;0,05). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical care associated with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (odds ratio 1,052 (1,009-1,101); p=0,0043) and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (1,968 (1,389-2,590) p\&lt;0,0001) both at the time of hospital admission. The AUC-ROC for the combined model was 0,83 (0,76-0,90) (vs AUC-ROC SOFA p\&lt;0,05) Interpretation: Patients COVID-19 positive presenting at admission with high SOFA score ≥2 combined with CRP ≥ 9,1 mg/mL could help clinicians to identify them as a group that will more likely require critical care so further actions might be implemented to improve their prognosis{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Hydroxychloroquine has been touted as a COVID-19 treatment. Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of IL-6, has been proposed as a treatment of critically ill patients. Objective: To describe the association between mortality and hydroxychloroquine or tocilizumab therapy among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design: Retrospective observational cohort study of electronic health records Setting: 13-hospital network spanning the state of New Jersey. Participants: Patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 with positive polymerase chain reaction results for SARS-CoV-2. Follow up was through May 5, 2020. Main Outcomes: The primary outcome was death. Results: Among 2512 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 there have been 547 deaths (22\%), 1539 (61\%) discharges and 426 (17\%) remain hospitalized. 1914 (76\%) received at least one dose of hydroxychloroquine and 1473 (59\%) received hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. After adjusting for imbalances via propensity modeling, compared to receiving neither drug, there were no significant differences in associated mortality for patients receiving any hydroxychloroquine during the hospitalization (HR, 0.99 [95\% CI, 0.80-1.22]), hydroxychloroquine alone (HR, 1.02 [95\% CI, 0.83-1.27]), or hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (HR, 0.98 [95\% CI, 0.75-1.28]). The 30-day unadjusted mortality for patients receiving hydroxychloroquine alone, azithromycin alone, the combination or neither drug was 25\%, 20\%, 18\%, and 20\%, respectively. Among 547 evaluable ICU patients, including 134 receiving tocilizumab in the ICU, an exploratory analysis found a trend towards an improved survival association with tocilizumab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.76 [95\% CI, 0.57-1.00]), with 30 day unadjusted mortality with and without tocilizumab of 46\% versus 56\%. Conclusions: This observational cohort study suggests hydroxychloroquine, either alone or in combination with azithromycin, was not associated with a survival benefit among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab demonstrated a trend association towards reduced mortality among ICU patients. Our findings are limited to hospitalized patients and must be interpreted with caution while awaiting results of randomized trials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background \& aims
New York is the current epicenter of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected disproportionately. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse outcomes independently from age, gender and other comorbidities.
Methods
This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality.
Results
200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30 kg/m2. The median age was 64 years. Hypertension (76\%), hyperlipidemia (46.2\%), and diabetes (39.5\%) were the three most common comorbidities. Fever (86\%), cough (76.5\%), and dyspnea (68\%) were the three most common symptoms. 24\% died during hospitalization (BMI {\textless} 25 kg/m2: 31.6\%, BMI 25–34 kg/m2: 17.2\%, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2: 34.8\%, p = 0.03). Increasing age (analyzed in quartiles), male sex, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25–34 kg/m2), heart failure, CAD, and CKD or ESRD were found to have a significant univariate association with mortality. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25–34 kg/m2, OR: 3.78; 95\% CI: 1.45–9.83; p = 0.006), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95\% CI: 1.25–5.98; p = 0.011) and increasing age (analyzed in quartiles, OR: 1.73; 95\% CI: 1.13–2.63; p = 0.011) were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Similarly, age, male sex, BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 and current or prior smoking were significant predictors for increasing oxygenation requirements in the multivariate analysis, while male sex, age and BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 were significant predictors in the multivariate analysis for the outcome of intubation.
Conclusions
In this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe obesity, increasing age, and male sex were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general worse in-hospital outcomes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a prognostic model for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients using routinely collected demographic and clinical characteristics. DESIGN Multicenter, retrospective cohort study. SETTING Jinyintan Hospital, Union Hospital, and Tongji Hosptial in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS A pooled derivation cohort of 1008 COVID-19 patients from Jinyintan Hospital, Union Hospital in Wuhan and an external validation cohort of 1031 patients from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality, treating discharged alive from hospital as the competing event. Fine-Gray models, using backward elimination for inclusion of predictor variables and allowing non-linear effects of continuous variables, were used to derive a prognostic model for predicting in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients. Internal validation was implemented to check model overfitting using bootstrap approach. External validation to a separate hospital was implemented to evaluate the generalizability of the model. RESULTS The derivation cohort was a case-mix of mild-to-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n=1008, 43.6\% females, median age 55). The final model (PLANS), including five predictor variables of platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex, had an excellent predictive performance (optimism-adjusted C-index: 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.83 to 0.87; averaged calibration slope: 0.95, 95\% CI: 0.82 to 1.08). Internal validation showed little overfitting. External validation using an independent cohort (n=1031, 47.8\% female, median age 63) demonstrated excellent predictive performance (C-index: 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.85 to 0.89; calibration slope: 1.02, 95\% CI: 0.92 to 1.12). The averaged predicted survival curves were close to the observed survival curves across patients with different risk profiles. CONCLUSIONS The PLANS model based on the five routinely collected demographic and clinical characteristics (platelet count, lymphocyte count, age, neutrophil count, and sex) showed excellent discriminative and calibration accuracy in predicting in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. This prognostic model would assist clinicians in better triaging patients and allocating healthcare resources to reduce COVID-19 fatality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND: Increasing attention has been paid to cardiac involvement in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Yet, scarce information is available regarding the morphological and functional features of cardiac impairments in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective and serial echocardiographic study to investigate the structural and functional cardiac changes among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). From January 21 to April 8, 2020, a total of 51 ICU patients (31 critically ill and 20 severely ill) with confirmed COVID-19 were monitored by serial transthoracic echocardiography examinations. Outcomes were followed up until April 8, 2020. RESULTS: Of 51 ICU patients, 33 (64.7\%) had cardiovascular comorbidities. Elevations of levels of cardiac biomarkers including high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (hs-cTnI) and brain natriuretic peptide were observed in 62.7\% and 86.3\% of patients, respectively. Forty-two (82.3\%) had at least one left-heart and/or right-heart echocardiographic abnormality. The overall median left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 65.0\% (IQR 58.0-69.0\%), with most (44,86.3\%) having preserved LVEF. Sixteen patients (31.4\%) had increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure, and 14 (27.5\%) had right-ventricle (RV) enlargement. During the study period, 12 (23.5\%) patients died. LVEF was comparable between survivors and non-survivors, while non-survivors had more often pulmonary hypertension (58.3\% vs. 23.1\%; P=0.028) and RV enlargement (58.3\% vs. 17.9\%, P=0.011). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated similar survival curves between patients with vs. without echocardiographic left-heart abnormalities (P=0.450 by log-rank test), while right-heart abnormalities had adverse impact on mortality (P=0.012 by log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Typical cardiac abnormality in ICU patients with COVID-19 was right-heart dysfunction with preserved LVEF. Echocardiographic right-heart dysfunction was associated with disease severity and increased mortality in patients affected by COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: In the early phase of the coronavirus disease-19 (Covid-19) pandemic, Southwest Finland remained relatively spared. By the 3rd of May 2020, a total of 28 patients have been admitted to the Turku University Hospital. In this paper, we explore baseline characteristics in order to identify risk for severe Covid-19 disease and critical care admission. Methods For this retrospective cohort study, data were derived from hospital records. Basic descriptive statistics were used to characterise patients, including medians, percentiles and frequencies. Differences were tested with Mann Whitney U-test and Pearson9s chi-square test. Results Pre-existent obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) was present in 29\% of patients admitted in the hospital for Covid-19, none of them having severe OSA. Overall, other findings on admission were comparable with those reported elsewhere. C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were higher in patients who were eventually transferred to critical care in comparison to in those who were not (median CRP 187 mg/L versus 52 mg/L, p\&lt;0.005 and median PCT 0.46 versus 0.12, p=0.047). Moreover, there was a trend towards lower oxygen saturation on admission in ICU-patients (87\% versus 93\%, p=0.09). Discussion OSA was pre-existent in a disproportional large group of patients, which suggests that it is an important risk factor for severe Covid-19. Furthermore, we identified high CRP, PCT and possibly oxygen saturation as useful clinical measures to identify patients at risk for critical care.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Rationale: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is now a global health concern.Objectives: We compared the clinical characteristics, laboratory examinations, computed tomography images, and treatments of patients with COVID-19 from three different cities in China.Methods: A total of 476 patients were recruited from January 1, 2020, to February 15, 2020, at three hospitals in Wuhan, Shanghai, and Anhui. The patients were divided into four groups according to age and into three groups (moderate, severe, and critical) according to the fifth edition of the Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of China.Measurements and Main Results: The incidence of comorbidities was higher in the severe (46.3\%) and critical (67.1\%) groups than in the moderate group (37.8\%). More patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers in the moderate group than in the severe and critical groups. More patients had multiple lung lobe involvement and pleural effusion in the critical group than in the moderate group. More patients received antiviral agents within the first 4 days in the moderate group than in the severe group, and more patients received antibiotics and corticosteroids in the critical and severe groups. Patients {\textgreater}75 years old had a significantly lower survival rate than younger patients.Conclusions: Multiple organ dysfunction and impaired immune function were the typical characteristics of patients with severe or critical illness. There was a significant difference in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers among patients with different severities of disease. Involvement of multiple lung lobes and pleural effusion were associated with the severity of COVID-19. Advanced age (≥75 yr) was a risk factor for mortality.},

Methods From March 16 to April 30, 2020, patients with MS or related disorders at NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center were identiﬁed with laboratory-conﬁrmed or suspected COVID19. The diagnosis was established using a standardized questionnaire or by review of in-patient hospital records.
Results We identiﬁed 76 patients (55 with relapsing MS, of which 9 had pediatric onset; 17 with progressive MS; and 4 with related disorders). Thirty-seven underwent PCR testing and were conﬁrmed positive. Of the entire group, 64 (84\%) patients were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) including anti-CD20 therapies (n = 34, 44.7\%) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (n = 10, 13.5\%). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever and cough, but 21.1\% of patients had neurologic symptom recrudescence preceding or coinciding with the infection. A total of 18 (23.7\%) were hospitalized; 8 (10.5\%) had COVID-19 critical illness or related death. Features more common among those hospitalized or with critical illness or death were older age, presence of comorbidities, progressive disease, and a nonambulatory status. No DMT class was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or fatal outcome.
Conclusions Most patients with MS with COVID-19 do not require hospitalization despite being on DMTs. Factors associated with critical illness were similar to the general at-risk patient population. DMT use did not emerge as a predictor of poor COVID-19 outcome in this preliminary sample.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background\&amp;Aims: The Milan metropolitan area in Northern Italy was among the most severely hit by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence trends of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy asymptomatic adults, the risk factors, and laboratory correlates. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a random sample of blood donors since the start of the outbreak (February 24th to April 8th 2020, n=789). Presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay. Results: The test had a 100/98.3 sensitivity/specificity, and for IgG+ was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (N=34, P\&lt;0.001). At the outbreak start, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7\%, 95\% c.i. 0.3-6\% (P\&lt;0.0001 vs. 120 historical controls). During the study period characterized by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2\%, 95\% c.i. 2.4-9.0, due to a rise in IgG+ tests to 5\%, 95\%CI 2.8-8.2 (P=0.004 for trend, adjusted weekly increase 2.7+/-1.3\%), but not of IgM+ (P=NS). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, seroconversion to IgG+ was more frequent in younger (P=0.043), while recent infections (IgM+) in older individuals (P=0.002). IgM+ was independently associated with higher triglycerides, eosinophils, and lymphocytes (P\&lt;0.05). Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the outbreak start. Social distancing may have been more effective in younger individuals, and by the end of April 2.4-9.0\% of healthy adults had evidence of seroconversion. Asymptomatic infection may affect lipid profile and blood count.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic with Europe and the USA at its epicenter. Little is known about risk factors for progression to severe disease in Europe. This study aims to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 patients in a Swiss university hospital. Methods This retrospective observational study included all adult patients hospitalized with a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 1 to March 25, 2020. We extracted data from electronic health records. The primary outcome was the need to mechanical ventilation at day 14. We used multivariate logistic regression to identify risk factors for mechanical ventilation. Follow-up was of at least 14 days. Results 200 patients were included, of whom 37 (18.5\%) needed mechanical ventilation at 14 days. The median time from symptoms onset to mechanical ventilation was 9.5 days (IQR 7.00, 12.75). Multivariable regression showed increased odds of mechanical ventilation in males (3.26, 1.21-9.8; p=0.025), in patients who presented with a qSOFA score ≥2 (6.02, 2.09-18.82; p=0.001), with bilateral infiltrate (5.75, 1.91-21.06; p=0.004) or with a CRP of 40 mg/l or greater (4.73, 1.51-18.58; p=0.013). Conclusions This study gives some insight in the epidemiology and clinical course of patients admitted in a European tertiary hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex, high qSOFA score, CRP of 40 mg/l or greater and a bilateral radiological infiltrate could help clinicians identify patients at high risk for mechanical ventilation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We conducted the first large-scale general population study on lifestyle risk factors (smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, and excessive alcohol intake) for COVID-19 using prospective cohort data with national registry linkage to hospitalisation. Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4 ± 8.8 yr; 55.1\% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006–2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. There were 760 COVID-19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95\% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID-19. We also found a dose-dependent increase in risk of COVID-19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had 4-fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52–7.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. C-reactive protein levels were associated with elevated risk of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner, and partly (10–16\%) explained associations between adverse lifestyle and COVID-19. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51\% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, which might be partly explained by low grade inflammation. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Reliably identifying patients at increased risk for COVID-19 complications could guide clinical decisions, public health policies, and preparedness efforts. To date, the most globally accepted definitions of at-risk patients rely, primarily, on epidemiological characterization of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, such characterization overlooks, and fails to correct for, the prevalence of existing conditions in the wider SARS-CoV-2 positive population. Here, we analyze the complete medical records of all SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (N=4,353) in a large Israeli health organization (representing a population of 2.3 million people), of whom 173 experienced moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19, to identify the conditions that increase the risk of disease complications, in various age and sex strata. Our analysis suggests that cardiovascular and kidney diseases, obesity, and hypertension are significant risk factors for COVID-19 complications, as previously reported. Interestingly, it also indicates that depression (e.g., odds ratio, OR, for males 65 years or older: 2.94, 95\% confidence intervals [1.55, 5.58]; P-value = 0.014) as well cognitive and neurological disorder (e.g., OR for individuals ≥ 65 year old: 2.65 [1.69, 4.17]; P-value \&lt; 0.001) are significant risk factors; and that smoking and background of respiratory diseases do not significantly increase the risk of complications. Adjusting existing risk definitions following these observations may improve their accuracy and impact the global pandemic containment efforts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background. With its high prevalence of chronic non-degenerative diseases, it is suspected that in Mexico there is a high risk of fatal complications from COVID-19. The present study aims to estimate the risk factors for hospitalisation and death in the Mexican population infected by SARS-CoV-2. Methods and Findings. We used the publicly available data released by the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Diseases of the Mexican Ministry of Health (Secretaria de Salud, SS). All records of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were included. Two multiple logistic regression models were fitted to estimate the association between the hospitalisation and mortality, with other covariables. Data on 10,544 individuals (57.68\% men), with mean age 46.47 SD 15.62, were analysed. Men were about 1.54 times as likely to be hospitalized than women (p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.37-1.74); individuals aged 50-74 and \&gt;=74 years were more likely to be hospitalized than people from 25-49 years (OR 2.05, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.81-2.32, and OR 23.84, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 2.90-5.15, respectively). People with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes were more likely to be hospitalised than people without these morbidities (p\&lt;0.01). Men had more risk of death in comparison to women (OR=1.53, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.30-1.81) and individuals aged 50-74 and ≥75 years were more likely to die than people from 25-49 years (OR 1.96, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.63-2.34, and OR 3.74, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 2.80-4.98, respectively). Hypertension, obesity, and diabetes presented in combination, provided a higher risk of dying in comparison to not having these diseases (OR=2.10; p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 1.50-2.93). Hospitalisation, intubation and pneumonia conferred a higher risk of dying (OR 5.02, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 3.88-6.50; OR 4.27, p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 3.26-5.59, and OR=2.57; p\&lt;0.001, 95\% C.I. 2.11-3.13, respectively). The main limitation of our study is the lack of information on mild (asymptomatic) or moderate cases of COVID-19. Conclusions. The present study points out that in Mexico, where an important proportion of the population develops two or more chronic conditions simultaneously, high mortality is a sever outcome for those infected by SARS-CoV-2.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background In Kuwait, prior to the first case of COVID-19 being reported in the country, mass screening of incoming travelers from countries with known outbreaks was performed and resulted in the first identified cases in the country. All COVID-19 cases at the time and subsequently after, were transferred to a single center, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, where the patients received standardized investigations and treatments. The objective of this study was to characterize the demographics, clinical manifestations and outcomes in this unique patient population. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 24th February 2020 and 20th April 2020. All consecutive patients in the entire State of Kuwait diagnosed with COVID-19 according to WHO guidelines and admitted to Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital were recruited. Patients received standardized investigations and treatments. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the associations between risk factors and outcomes. Findings Of 1096 patients, the median age was 41 years and 81\% of patients were male. Most patients were asymptomatic on admission (49.5\%), 69.4\% had no signs of infection and 94.6\% were afebrile. Only 3.6\% of patients required an ICU admission and 1.7\% were dead at the study cutoff date. On multivariate analysis, the risk factors found to be significantly associated with admission to intensive care were age above 50 years old, a qSOFA score above 0, smoking, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin levels. Asthma, smoking and elevated procalcitonin levels correlated significantly with mortality in our cohort. Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first large retrospective cohort study observing the characteristics of the initial consecutive COVID-19 patients of an entire country. Further, large proportion of asymptomatic patients provides novel insights into the clinical features of patients with milder disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The COVID-19 is rapidly scattering worldwide, and the number of cases in the Eastern Mediterranean Region is rising, there is a need for immediate targeted actions. We designed a longitudinal study in a hot outbreak zone to analyze the serial findings between infected patients for detecting temporal changes from February 2020. In a hospital-based open-cohort study, patients are followed from admission until one year from their discharge (the 1st, 4th, 12th weeks, and the first year). The measurements included demographic, socio-economics, symptoms, health service diagnosis and treatment, contact history, and psychological variables. The signs improvement, death, length of stay in hospital were considered as primary, and impaired pulmonary function and psychotic disorders were considered as main secondary outcomes. Notably, In the last two follow-ups, each patient attends the hospital to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Moreover, clinical symptoms and respiratory functions are being determined in such follow-ups. Among the first 600 COVID-19 cases, a total of 490 patients with complete information (39\% female; the average age of 57 ± 15 years) were analyzed. Seven percent of these patients died. The three main leading causes of admission were: fever (77\%), dry cough (73\%), and fatigue (69\%). The most prevalent comorbidities between COVID-19 patients were hypertension (35\%), diabetes (28\%), and ischemic heart disease (14\%). The percentage of primary composite endpoints (PCEP), defined as death, the use of mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit was 18\%. The following comorbidities were significantly different in the positive and negative PCEP groups: acute kidney disease (p=0.008) and diabetes (p=0.026). For signs and symptoms, fatigue (p=0.020) and sore throat (p=0.001) were significantly different. This long-term prospective Cohort may support healthcare professionals in the management of resources following this pandemic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Organ graft recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy are likely to be at heighted risk for the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) and adverse outcomes including death. It is therefore important to characterize the clinical course and outcome of Covid-19 in this vulnerable population and identify therapeutic strategies that are safe. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 54 adult kidney transplant patients diagnosed with Covid-19 and managed in New York State, the epicenter of Covid-19 pandemic. The patients were evaluated by video visits, phone interviews, or in the Emergency Room for respiratory illness symptoms consistent with Covid-19 from March 13, 2020 to April 20, 2020. Characteristics of the patients were stratified by hospitalization status and disease severity. Clinical course including alterations in immunosuppressive therapy were retrieved from their electronic medical records. Primary outcomes included recovery from Covid-19 symptoms, acute kidney injury, graft failure, and case fatality rate. Results: Of the 54 SARS-Cov-2 positive kidney transplant recipients, 39 with moderate to severe symptoms were admitted and 15 with mild symptoms were managed at home. Hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients were more likely to be male, of Hispanic ethnicity, and to have cardiovascular disease. At baseline, all but 2 were receiving tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and 32 were on a steroid free immunosuppression regimen. Tacrolimus dosage was reduced in 46\% of hospitalized patients and maintained at baseline level in the non-hospitalized cohort. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dosage was maintained at the baseline dosage in 11\% of hospitalized patients and 64\% of non-hospitalized patients, and was stopped in 61\% hospitalized patients and 0\% in the non-hospitalized cohort. Azithromycin or doxycycline were prescribed at a similar rate among hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients (38\% vs. 40\%). Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed in 79\% of hospitalized patients and only one of 15 non-hospitalized patients. Acute kidney injury occurred in 51\% of hospitalized patients. Patients with severe disease were more likely to have elevations in inflammatory biomarkers at presentation. At a median of 21 days follow up, 67\% of patients have had their symptoms resolved or improved and 33\% have persistent symptoms. Graft failure requiring hemodialysis occurred in 3 of 39 hospitalized patients (8\%). Three of 39 (8\%) hospitalized patients expired and none of the 15 non-hospitalized patients expired. Conclusions: Clinical presentation of Covid-19 in kidney transplant recipients was similar to what has been described in the general population. The case fatality rate in our entire cohort of 54 kidney transplant recipients was reassuringly low and patients with mild symptomology could be successfully managed at home. Data from the pilot study suggest that a strategy of systematic screening and triage to inpatient or outpatient care, close monitoring, and judicious use of immunosuppressive drugs rather than cessation is beneficial.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In order to assess for confounding, we produced - to our knowledge - the first multivariable adjusted estimate of the association of racial characteristics with Covid-19. Our adjusted estimates indicated that black participants remained at over threefold increased risk of Covid-19 relative to white participants. Exploratory analyses identified that 22.9\% of Covid-19 positive black patients were using either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, relative to just 6.7\% of all black participants. Our genetic analyses confirmed the finding of a previous report noting an association of blood type A with Covid-19, and we discovered a novel genetic association with HLA DQA1\_509 that remained significant even after Bonferroni correction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Emerging data on the clinical presentation, diagnostics, and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 have largely been presented as case series. Few studies have compared these clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 to other acute respiratory illnesses. Methods: We examined all patients presenting to an emergency department in San Francisco, California between February 3 and March 31, 2020 with an acute respiratory illness who were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We determined COVID-19 status by PCR and metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). We compared demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory results including viral diagnostics using PCR and mNGS. Among those hospitalized, we determined differences in treatment (antibiotics, antivirals, respiratory support) and outcomes (ICU admission, ICU interventions, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac injury). Findings: In a cohort of 316 patients, 33 (10\%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 31 patients, all without COVID-19, tested positive for another respiratory virus (16\%). Among patients with additional viral testing, no co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 were identified by PCR or mNGS. Patients with COVID-19 reported longer symptoms duration (median 7 vs. 3 days), and were more likely to report fever (82\% vs. 44\%), fatigue (85\% vs. 50\%), and myalgias (61\% vs 27\%); p\&lt;0.001 for all comparisons. Lymphopenia (55\% vs 34\%, p=0.018) and bilateral opacities on initial chest radiograph (55\% vs. 24\%, p=0.001) were more common in patients with COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were more often hospitalized (79\% vs. 56\%, p=0.014). Of 186 hospitalized patients, patients with COVID-19 had longer hospitalizations (median 10.7d vs. 4.7d, p\&lt;0.001) and were more likely to develop ARDS (23\% vs. 3\%, p\&lt;0.001). Most comorbidities, home medications, signs and symptoms, vital signs, laboratory results, treatment, and outcomes did not differ by COVID-19 status. Interpretation: While we found differences in clinical features of COVID-19 compared to other acute respiratory illnesses, there was significant overlap in presentation and comorbidities. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to the hospital, have longer hospitalizations and develop ARDS, and were unlikely to have co-existent viral infections. These findings enhance understanding of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison to other acute respiratory illnesses. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Italy was the first European country hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and has the highest number of recorded COVID-19 deaths in Europe. This prospective cohort study of the correlates of the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was conducted at the Infectious Diseases and Intensive Care units of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. The clinical characteristics of all the COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the early days of the epidemic (21 February -19 March 2020) were recorded upon admission, and the time-dependent probability of death was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method (censored as of 20 April 2020). Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the factors independently associated with the risk of death. Forty-eight (20.6 \%) of the 233 patients followed up for a median of 40 days (interquartile range 33–47) died during the follow-up. Most were males (69.1 \%) and their median age was 61 years (IQR 50–72). The time-dependent probability of death was 19.7 \% (95 \% CI 14.6–24.9 \%) 30 days after hospital admission. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.08, 95 \% CI 1.48−2.92 per ten years more) and obesity (aHR 3.04, 95 \% CI 1.42−6.49) were independently associated with an increased risk of death, which was also associated with critical disease (aHR 8.26, 95 \% CI 1.41−48.29), C-reactive protein levels (aHR 1.17, 95 \% CI 1.02−1.35 per 50 mg/L more) and creatinine kinase levels above 185 U/L (aHR 2.58, 95 \% CI 1.37−4.87) upon admission. Case-fatality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the early days of the Italian epidemic was about 20 \%. Our study adds evidence to the notion that older age, obesity and more advanced illness are factors associated to an increased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rationale: The Infectious Diseases Society of America has identified the use of SARS-CoV-2 genomic load for prognostication purposes as a key research question. Objectives: We explored the SARS-CoV-2 genomic load as a risk factor for adverse patient outcomes. Methods: A retrospective cohort study among adult patients admitted to the hospital between March 31st to April 10th, 2020 with COVID-19 pneumonia was conducted. We segregated patients into 3 genomic load groups: low (Cycle threshold (Ct) ≥35), intermediate (25 \&lt; Ct \&lt; 35), and high (Ct ≤ 25) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Measurements: A composite outcome of death, intubation, and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used. Secondary outcomes included the severity of pneumonia on admission, as measured by the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). Main Results: Of 457 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from March 31st to April 10th, 2020, 316 met inclusion criteria. Included patients were followed for a median of 25 days (IQR 21-28). High genomic load at presentation was associated with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (p=0.005), transplant recipient status (p\&lt;0.001), and duration of illness less than 7 days (p=0.005). Importantly, patients with high genomic load were more likely to reach the primary endpoint (p=0.001), and had higher PSI scores on admission (p=0.03). In multivariate analysis, a high genomic load remained an independent predictor of the primary outcome. Results remained significant in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a high genomic load of SARS-CoV-2 at the time of admission is an independent predictor of adverse outcomes, that above and beyond age, comorbidity, and severity of illness on presentation, may be used to risk-stratify patients, and call for a quantitative diagnostic assay to become available. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND: Health-care workers (HCWs) have increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Information about the prevalence and risk factors for adverse outcomes in HCWs is scarce in Mexico. Here, we aimed to explore prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, symptoms, and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCWs in Mexico City. METHODS: We explored data collected by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City. All cases underwent real-time RT-PCR test. We explored outcomes related to severe COVID-19 in HCWs and the diagnostic performance of symptoms to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs. RESULTS: As of July 2nd, 2020, 34,263 HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 10,925 were confirmed (31.9\%). Overall, 4,200 were nurses (38.4\%), 3,244 physicians (29.7\%), 126 dentists (1.15\%) and 3,355 laboratory personnel and other HCWs (30.7\%). After follow-up, 992 HCWs required hospitalization (9.08\%), 206 developed severe outcomes (1.89\%), and 90 required mechanical-ventilatory support (0.82\%). Lethality was recorded in 224 (2.05\%) cases. Symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity were fever, cough, malaise, shivering, myalgias at evaluation but neither had significant predictive value. We also identified 333 asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.05\%). Older HCWs with chronic non-communicable diseases, pregnancy, and severe respiratory symptoms were associated with higher risk for adverse outcomes. Physicians had higher risk for hospitalization and for severe outcomes compared with nurses and other HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs in Mexico City. No symptomatology can accurately discern HCWs with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Particular attention should focus on HCWs with risk factors to prevent adverse outcomes and reduce infection risk.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Introduction Use of high flow nasal therapy (HFNT) to treat COVID-19 pneumonia has been greatly debated around the world due to concern for increased healthcare worker transmission and delays in invasive mechanical Ventilation (IMV). Methods A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from March 10, 2020, to May 17, 2020 with moderate to severe respiratory failure treated with High Flow nasal therapy (HFNT). HFNT patients were divided into two groups: HFNT only and HFNT progressed to IMV. The primary outcome was the ability of the ROX index to predict the need of IMV. Results Of the 837 patients with COVID-19, 129 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 60.8 (±13.6) years, BMI 32.6 (±8), 58 (45 \%) were female, 72 (55.8\%) were African American, 40 (31\%) Hispanic. 48 (37.2\%) were smokers. Mean time to intubation was 2.5 days (± 3.3). ROX index of less than 5 at HFNT initiation was predictive of progression to IMV (OR = 2.137, p = 0,052). Any decrease in ROX index after HFNT initiation was predictive of intubation (OR= 14.67, p \&lt;0.0001). ΔROX (\&lt;=0 versus \&gt;0), peak D-dimer \&gt;4000 and admission GFR \&lt; 60 ml/min were very strongly predictive of need for IMV (ROC = 0.86, p=). Mortality was 11.2\% in HFNT only group versus 47.5\% in the HFNT progressed to IMV group (p,0.0001). Mortality and need for pulmonary vasodilators were higher in the HNFT progressed to IMV group. Conclusion ROX index is a valuable, noninvasive tool to evaluate patients with moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 treated with HFNT. ROX helps predicts need for IMV and thus limiting morbidity and mortality associated with IMV.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods: The study population included the 14,000 members of Leumit Health Services who were tested for COVID-19 infection from February 1st to April 30th, 2020, and who had at least one previous blood test for plasma 25(OH)D level. "Suboptimal" or "low" plasma 25(OH)D level was defined as plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, concentration below 30 ng/mL. Results: Of 7,807 individuals, 782 (10.1\%) were COVID-19-positive, and 7,025 (89.9\%) COVID-19-negative. The mean plasma vitamin D level was significantly lower among those who tested positive than negative for COVID-19 [19.00 ng/mL (95\% confidence interval [CI] 18.41-19.59) vs. 20.55 (95\% CI 20.32-20.78)]. Univariate analysis demonstrated an association between low plasma 25(OH)D level and increased likelihood of COVID-19 infection [crude odds ratio (OR) of 1.58 (95\% CI 1.24-2.01, p\&lt;0.001)], and of hospitalization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [crude OR of 2.09 (95\% CI 1.01-4.30, p\&lt;0.05)].

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deteriorates suddenly primarily due to excessive inflammatory injury, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is implicated in endocrine control of the immune system. However, the effect of IGF-1 levels on COVID-19 prognosis remains unknown. Objective: To investigate the association between circulating IGF-1 concentrations and mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Design: Prospective analysis. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: 1425 COVID-19 patients who had pre-diagnostic serum IGF-1 measurements at baseline (2006-2010). Main outcome measures: COVID-19 mortality (available death data updated to 22 May 2020). Unconditional logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of mortality across the IGF-1 quartiles. Results: Among 1425 COVID-19 patients, 365 deaths occurred due to COVID-19. Compared to the lowest quartile of IGF-1 concentrations, the highest quartile was associated with a 37\% lower risk of mortality (OR: 0.63, 95\% CI: 0.43-0.93, P-trend=0.03). The association was stronger in women and nonsmokers (both P-interaction=0.01). Conclusions: Higher IGF-1 concentrations are associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 mortality. Further studies are required to determine whether and how targeting IGF-1 pathway might improve COVID-19 prognosis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Although cancer has been associated with COVID-19 risk and mortality in hospital-based studies, few population-based studies have been reported. Utilizing data from the UK Biobank (UKB), a population-based prospective cohort, we formally tested the association of over 44 different types of cancer with COVID-19 infection and mortality among 7,661 subjects who were tested by June 17, 2020. Compared to non-cancer subjects, cancer subjects (N=1,521) had significantly lower overall risk for COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.79 (0.68-0.92), P=2.60E-03]. However, a trend of higher risk for COVID-19 mortality was found among 256 COVID-19 positive cancer patients, especially for hematologic cancers such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma [3.82 (1.17-12.01), P=0.02]. In cancer patients, while few demographic, lifestyle, genetic and comorbidity factors predicted risk for COVID-19 infection, older age, male sex, heart disease and hypertension significantly predicted COVID-19 mortality. The lower risk for COVID-19 infection is likely due to extra caution in COVID-19 prevention and more testing among cancer patients, an encouraging finding that demonstrates the feasibility of intervention. These results, if confirmed in future releases of UKB data and other independent populations, may provide guidance for COVID-19 prevention and treatment among cancer patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding innate immune responses in COVID-19 is important for deciphering mechanisms of host responses and interpreting disease pathogenesis. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate effector lymphocytes that respond to acute viral infections, but might also contribute to immune pathology. Here, using 28-color flow cytometry, we describe a state of strong NK cell activation across distinct subsets in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients, a pattern mirrored in scRNA-seq signatures of lung NK cells. Unsupervised high-dimensional analysis identified distinct immunophenotypes that were linked to disease severity. Hallmarks of these immunophenotypes were high expression of perforin, NKG2C, and Ksp37, reflecting a high presence of adaptive NK cell expansions in circulation of patients with severe disease. Finally, arming of CD56bright NK cells was observed in course of COVID-19 disease states, driven by a defined protein-protein interaction network of inflammatory soluble factors. This provides a detailed map of the NK cell activation-landscape in COVID-19 disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The prevalence and significance of digestive manifestations in COVID-19 remain uncertain. Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were manually abstracted from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19. Results: A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53\% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34\%), nausea (27\%), vomiting (16\%), and abdominal pain (11\%). In 74\% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35\% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were elevated to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77\% of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio 0.93, 95\% confidence interval 0.76-1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission (odds ratio 1.31, 95\% confidence interval 0.80-2.12) were not independently associated with mechanical ventilation or death. Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, gastrointestinal symptoms and liver test abnormalities were common but the majority were mild and their presence was not associated with a more severe clinical course.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Preventing communicable diseases requires understanding the spread, epidemiology, clinical features, progression, and prognosis of the disease. Early identification of risk factors and clinical outcomes might help to identify critically ill patients, provide proper treatment and prevent mortality. Methods: We conducted a prospective study in patients with flu-like symptoms referred to the imaging department of a tertiary hospital in IRAN between 3 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. Patients with COVID-19 were followed up to check their health condition after two months. The categorical data between groups were analyzed by Fisher exact test and continuous data by Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test. Findings: 319 patients (mean age 45.48 years, 177 women) were enrolled. Fever, dyspnea, weakness, shivering, C-reactive protein (CRP), fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, anosmia, ageusia, dizziness, sweating and age were the most important symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Traveling in past three months, asthma, taking corticosteroids, liver disease, rheumatological disease, cough with sputum, eczema, conjunctivitis, tobacco use, and chest pain did not have any relationship with COVID-19. Interpretation: Finding clinical symptoms for early diagnosis of COVID-19 is a critical part of prevention. These symptoms can help in the assessment of disease progression. To the best of our knowledge, some of the effective features on the mortality due to COVID-19 are investigated for the first time in this research. Funding: None{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rationale: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause a viral pneumonia together with other extrapulmonary complications. Acute cardiac related injury (ACRI) is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Objective: To explain the pathological mechanism of ACRI and improve the treatment strategy by retrospectively observing the factors associated with ACRI and factors affecting the prognosis of ACRI with COVID-19 at an early stage. Methods: 619 COVID-19 patients were from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. T test was used for continuous variables while Chi-square test for categorical factors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence interval (CI). Results: Among the 619 OOS Level-I hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 102 (16.5\%) were defined as ACRI (stage-1: 59 cases, stage-2: 43 cases). 50\% of ACRI patients developed into severe cases and 25 patients died (CFR=24.5\%), 42 times that of non-ACRI patients. Elderly (OR=2.83, P\&lt;0.001) , HTN (OR=2.09, P=0.005), γ-globulin (OR=2.08, P=0.004), TCM (OR=0.55, P=0.017), PLT (OR=2.94, P\&lt;0.001) and NLR (OR=2.20, P=0.004) were independently correlated with ACRI. SBP≥140, dyspnea, DM, smoking history were correlated with ACRI-stage2 only. In the prognostic subgroup analysis of ACRI patients,γ-globulin treatment could prolong LOS. TCM (OR=0.26, P=0.006), SBP≥160 (OR= 22.70, P=0.005), male (OR=2.66, P=0.044) were associated with severe illness while corticosteroids treatment (OR=3.34, P=0.033) and male (OR=4.303, P=0.008) with death. Surprisingly, we found the mortality of non-elderly patients is higher than elderly (32.4\% VS 20.0\%, P=0.164), and both IKF and RASI treatment were not correlated with any prognostic indicators including severe, death and LOS. Conclusion: This study observed that several non-traditional issues were associated with early cardiac injury in COVID-19 while many traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not. Besides elderly and male, hypertension was confirmed to be the most important risk factor.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Objective To describe outcomes of people admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in the United States, and the clinical and laboratory characteristics associated with severity of illness.
Design Prospective cohort study.
Setting Single academic medical center in New York City and Long Island.
Participants 5279 patients with laboratory confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection between 1 March 2020 and 8 April 2020. The final date of follow up was 5 May 2020.
Main outcome measures Outcomes were admission to hospital, critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice care, or death), and discharge to hospice care or death. Predictors included patient characteristics, medical history, vital signs, and laboratory results. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for adverse outcomes, and competing risk survival analysis for mortality.
Results Of 11 544 people tested for SARS-Cov-2, 5566 (48.2\%) were positive. After exclusions, 5279 were included. 2741 of these 5279 (51.9\%) were admitted to hospital, of whom 1904 (69.5\%) were discharged alive without hospice care and 665 (24.3\%) were discharged to hospice care or died. Of 647 (23.6\%) patients requiring mechanical ventilation, 391 (60.4\%) died and 170 (26.2\%) were extubated or discharged. The strongest risk for hospital admission was associated with age, with an odds ratio of {\textgreater}2 for all age groups older than 44 years and 37.9 (95\% confidence interval 26.1 to 56.0) for ages 75 years and older. Other risks were heart failure (4.4, 2.6 to 8.0), male sex (2.8, 2.4 to 3.2), chronic kidney disease (2.6, 1.9 to 3.6), and any increase in body mass index (BMI) (eg, for BMI {\textgreater}40: 2.5, 1.8 to 3.4). The strongest risks for critical illness besides age were associated with heart failure (1.9, 1.4 to 2.5), BMI {\textgreater}40 (1.5, 1.0 to 2.2), and male sex (1.5, 1.3 to 1.8). Admission oxygen saturation of {\textless}88\% (3.7, 2.8 to 4.8), troponin level {\textgreater}1 (4.8, 2.1 to 10.9), C reactive protein level {\textgreater}200 (5.1, 2.8 to 9.2), and D-dimer level {\textgreater}2500 (3.9, 2.6 to 6.0) were, however, more strongly associated with critical illness than age or comorbidities. Risk of critical illness decreased significantly over the study period. Similar associations were found for mortality alone.
Conclusions Age and comorbidities were found to be strong predictors of hospital admission and to a lesser extent of critical illness and mortality in people with covid-19; however, impairment of oxygen on admission and markers of inflammation were most strongly associated with critical illness and mortality. Outcomes seem to be improving over time, potentially suggesting improvements in care.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) are at high risk for thrombotic arterial and venous occlusions. At the same time, lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based occlusion of small vessels in patients who succumb to the disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an acquired and potentially life-threatening thrombophilia in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies (aPL) targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins. Small case series have recently detected aPL in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL (anticardiolipin IgG/IgM/IgA, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein I IgG/IgM/IgA, and anti- phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (PS/PT) IgG/IgM) in the sera of 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We detected anticardiolipin IgM antibodies in 23\%, anti-PS/PT IgG in 24\%, and anti-PS/PT IgM in 18\%. Any aPL was present in 52\% of patients using the manufacturer9s threshold and in 30\% using a more stringent cutoff (\&gt;40 units). Higher levels of aPL were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity (including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps/NETs), higher platelet count, more severe respiratory disease, and lower glomerular filtration rates. Similar to patients with known and longstanding APS, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from control neutrophils. Furthermore, injection of these COVID-19 IgG fractions into mice accelerated venous thrombosis. Taken together, these studies suggest that a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19 become at least transiently positive for aPL and that these aPL are potentially pathogenic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: There is currently a paucity of data describing bacterial coinfections, related antibiotic prescribing patterns, and the potential role of antimicrobial stewardship in the care of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods: This prospective, observational study was conducted from March 10, 2020 to April 21, 2020 in admitted patients with confirmed COVID-19. Patients were included if ≥ 18 years old and admitted to the hospital for further treatment. Data was collected via chart review from the enterprise electronic health record database. Data collected include factors driving antibiotic choice, indication, and duration of therapy as well as microbiological data. Findings: Antibiotics were initiated on admission in 87/147 (59\%) patients. Of these, 85/87 (98\%) prescriptions were empiric. The most common indication for empiric antibiotics was concern for community-acquired pneumonia (76/85, 89\%) with the most prescribed antibiotics being ceftriaxone and azithromycin. The median duration of antibiotic therapy was two days (interquartile range 1-5). No patients had a community-acquired bacterial respiratory coinfection, but 10/147 (7\%) of patients were found to have concurrent bacterial infections from a non-respiratory source, and one patient was diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis at the time of admission for COVID-19. Interpretation: Bacterial coinfection in patients with COVID-19 was infrequent. Antibiotics are likely unnecessary in patients with mild symptoms. There is little role for broad-spectrum antibiotics to empirically treat multidrug resistant organisms in patients with COVID-19, regardless of disease severity. Antimicrobial stewardship remains important in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background In hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, progression to acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism. We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for ICU and mortality. Methods We conducted a multicenter, observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose, MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation or death within 28 days (composite primary endpoint) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units. Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Results Findings are reported as MP (n=83) vs. control (n=90). The composite primary endpoint was met by 19 vs. 40 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.41; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.24-0.72]. Transfer to ICU and need for invasive MV was necessary in 15 vs. 27 (p=0.07) and 14 vs. 26 (p=0.10), respectively. By day 28, the MP group had fewer deaths (6 vs. 21, adjusted HR=0.29; 95\% CI: 0.12-0.73) and more days off invasive MV (24.0 plus-or-minus sign 9.0 vs. 17.5 plus-or-minus sign 12.8; p=0.001). Study treatment was associated with rapid improvement in PaO2:FiO2 and CRP levels. The complication rate was similar for the two groups (p=0.84). Conclusion In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early administration of prolonged MP treatment was associated with a significantly lower hazard of death (71\%) and decreased ventilator dependence. Randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}During the first pandemic wave Covid-19 reached Latin America cities. Aim: To report clinical features and outcomes associated to Covid-19 in a group of patients admitted during the first wave in a regional reference Center in southern Chile designated to severe and critical cases. Methods: Cases were identified by a compatible clinical picture associated to positive RT-PCR or serological testing. A standard protocol was applied. Results: 21 adult patients (20 diagnosed by PCR, one by serology) were admitted between epidemiological weeks 13 to 20, involving 8.8\% of total regional cases. Hospitalization occurred at a median of 11 days after symptoms onset. Patients ≥60 years old predominated (57.1\%). Hypertension (61.9\%), obesity (57.1\%) and diabetes mellitus 2 (38.1\%) were prevalent but 19\% had no comorbid conditions nor were elderly. Two cases involved second-trimester pregnant women. Positive IgM or IgM/IgG results obtained by rapid serological testing were limited (19\% at 1st week; 42.9\% at 2nd week). Nine patients (42.9\%, critical group) were transferred to ICU and connected to mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. By univariate analysis admission to ICU was significantly associated to tachypnea and higher plasmatic LDH values. One pregnant woman required urgent cesarean section given birth to a premature neonate without vertical transmission. Two patients died (in-hospital mortality 9.5\%) and length of stay was equal or higher than 14 days in 57.9\% of patients. Conclusion: In our regional Center, Covid 19 was associated to known risk factors, had a prolonged stay and in-hospital mortality. Tachypnea ≥30/min is predictive of transfer to ICU.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 32 adult critically ill patients admitted to a tertiary community hospital in upstate NY, between March 14th and April 12th, 2020. We collected demographic, laboratory, ventilator, and treatment data, which were analyzed and clinical outcomes tabulated. Results: 32 patients admitted to the ICU were included, with mean (±SD) follow-up duration 21 ± 7 days. Mean (±SD) age was 62.2 ± 11.2 years, and 62.5\% were men. 27 (84.4\%) of patients had one or more medical co-morbidities and 50\% of the patients were current or former smokers. The mean (±SD) duration of symptoms was 6.6 (±4.4) days before presentation, with cough (81.3\%), dyspnea (68.7\%), and fever (65.6\%) being most common. 23 (71.9\%) patients received invasive mechanical ventilation. 5 (15.6\%) had died, 11 (34.4\%) had been discharged home, and 16 (50\%) remained hospitalized, 8 (25\%) of which were still in ICU. Mean (±SD) length of ICU stay was 10.2 (±7.7) days, and mean (±SD) length of hospital stay was 14.8 (±7.7) days. Conclusion: Majority of patients were of older age and with medical co-morbidities. With adequate resource utilization, mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients may not be as high as previously suggested.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Infection by the new corona virus strain SARS-CoV-2 and its related syndrome COVID-19 has caused several hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Patients of higher age and with preexisting chronic health conditions are at an increased risk of fatal disease outcome. However, detailed information on causes of death and the contribution of comorbidities to death yet is missing. Here, we report autopsy findings on causes of death and comorbidities of 26 decedents that had clinically presented with severe COVID-19. We found that septic shock and multi organ failure was the most common immediate cause of death, often due to suppurative pulmonary infection. Respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar damage presented as the most immediate cause of death in fewer cases. Several comorbidities, such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and obesity were present in the vast majority of patients. Our findings reveal that causes of death were directly related to COVID-19 in the majority of decedents, while they appear not to be an immediate result of preexisting health conditions and comorbidities. We therefore suggest that the majority of patients had died of COVID-19 with only contributory implications of preexisting health conditions to the mechanism of death.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we analyse the frequency of CI in deceased COVID-19 patients. Methods: We included 477 adult cases that died after admission from March 1 to March 31, 2020: 281 with confirmed COVID-19, 58 probable COVID-19, and 138 who died of other causes. Results: The number of comorbidities was high in the confirmed COVID-19, and CI was common (30\%: 21.1\% dementia; 8.9\% mild cognitive impairment). Subjects with CI were older, more lived in nursing homes and had shorter times from symptom onset to death than those without CI. COVID-19 patients with CI were rarely admitted to the ICU and fewer received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, but palliative care was provided more often. Conclusions: Dementia is a frequent comorbidity in COVID-19 deceased patients. The burden of COVID-19 in the dementia community will be high.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We aimed to describe the characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients and give some suggestions to manage suspected COVID-19 patients. Methods We analyzed 616 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 35 SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients who were admitted in Wuhan Union Hospital from February 13, 2020 to February 16, 2020. Telephone interviews were conducted and medical records were reviewed for epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiographic data. Results Of the 35 SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative probable COVID-19 patients, all of them had tested at least 3 times of nucleic acid, 3 were believed to be non-SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with confirmed patients, antibody negative probable patients were younger (P=0.017), exhibited similar symptoms and chest CT images, had higher lymphocyte count (P=0.004) and albumin level (P\&lt;0.001), showed lower lactate dehydrogenase level (P=0.011) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P\&lt;0.001). During hospitalization, all the 35 patients had contacted with confirmed COVID-19 patients, but all used general face mask for protection and maintained a social distance of more than one meter from each other. All the isolation wards were kept ventilation and disinfected once a day. After discharged from hospital, all of them had negative nucleic acid tests and no one developed symptoms again. Conclusions The conditions of patients with AbN probable COVID-19 were less critical than those of patients with confirmed COVID-19. Room ventilation and daily disinfection, wearing face masks, and maintaining social distance might be helpful to prevent patients from hospital acquired COVID-19 infection.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We aimed to assess its benefit, drawing from observations in compassionately treated patients. Methods: In a retrospective case-control study, treatment effect (tocilizumab 400mg, single-dose) was assessed using three statistical methods: propensity-score matching, Cox multivariable survival and inverse probability score weighting (IPSW) analyses. Were included all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, who presented severity criteria with SpO2\&lt;96\% despite O2-support \&gt;6L/min for more than 6 hours. Were excluded patients in critical care medicine department and those under invasive mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was a composite of mortality and ventilation, with a maximum follow-up of 28 days. Results: 246 patients were included (106 treated by tocilizumab). They were 67.6 +/-15.3 years-old, with 95 (38.5\%) women. Delay between first symptoms and inclusion was 8.4 +/-4.5 days. Overall, 105 (42.7\%) patients presented the primary outcome, with 71 (28.9\%) deaths during the 28-days follow-up. Propensity-score-matched 84 pairs of comparable patients. In the matched cohort (n=168), tocilizumab was associated with fewer primary outcomes (hazard ratio (HR)=0.49 (95\% confidence interval (95CI)=0.3-0.81), p-value=0.005). These results were similar in the overall cohort (n=246), with Cox multivariable analysis yielding a protective association between tocilizumab and primary outcome (adjusted HR=0.26 (95CI=0.135-0.51, p=0.0001), confirmed by IPSW analysis (p\&lt;0.0001). Analyses on mortality with 28-days follow-up yielded similar results. Conclusion: In this retrospective study, tocilizumab single-dose was associated with improved survival without mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A major dogma in immunology has it that the IgM antibody response precedes secondary memory responses built on the production of IgG, IgA and, occasionaly, IgE. Here, we measured acute humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2, including the frequency of antibody-secreting cells and the presence of specific, neutralizing, antibodies in serum and broncho-alveolar fluid of 145 patients with COVID-19. Surprisingly, early SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses were found to be typically dominated by antibodies of the IgA isotype. Peripheral expansion of IgA-plasmablasts with mucosal-homing potential was detected shortly after the onset of symptoms and peaked during the third week of the disease. While the specific antibody response included IgG, IgM and IgA, the latter contributed to a much larger extent to virus neutralization, as compared to IgG. However, specific IgA serum levels notably decrease after one month of evolution. These results represent a challenging observation given the present uncertainty as to which kind of humoral response would optimally protect against re-infection, and whether vaccine regimens should consider boosting a potent, although, at least in blood, fading IgA response.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Severe COVID-19 patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome that may progress to respiratory failure. These patients also develop cytokine storm syndrome, and organ dysfunctions, which is a clinical picture that resembles sepsis. Considering that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described as an important factors of tissue damage in sepsis, we investigated whether NETs would be produced in COVID-19 patients and participate in the lung tissue damage. A cohort of 32 hospitalized patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and respective healthy controls were enrolled. NETs concentration was assessed by MPO-DNA PicoGreen assay or by confocal immunofluorescence. The cytotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2-induced NETs was analyzed in human epithelial lung cells (A549 cells). The concentration of NETs was augmented in plasma and tracheal aspirate from COVID-19 patients and their neutrophils spontaneously released higher levels of NETs. NETs were also found in the lung tissue specimens from autopsies of COVID-19 patients. Notably, viable SARS-CoV-2 can directly induce in vitro release of NETs by healthy neutrophils in a PAD-4-dependent manner. Finally, NETs released by SARS-CoV-2-activated neutrophils promote lung epithelial cell death in vitro. These results unravel a possible detrimental role of NETs in the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Therefore, the inhibition of NETs represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Introduction: Case registries of pregnant women diagnosed with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have reported that the majority experienced mild infection, but up to 9\% may require critical care. Most COVID-19 cases published were in the third trimester of pregnancy, which could reflect reporting bias, higher risk of infection or increased disease severity in late pregnancy. Seroprevalence studies may allow reliable estimates of the susceptibility to infection and clinical spectrum since they include asymptomatic and mild infections not tested for PCR. We evaluated the seroprevalence and clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in pregnant women in the first and third trimester. Methods: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at each institution and informed consent was obtained. We recruited 874 consecutive pregnancies attending for first trimester screening (10-16 weeks of gestation, n=372) or delivery (n=502) from April 14 to May 5. All women were interviewed with a structured questionnaire for COVID-19 symptoms two months prior to sampling. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM/IgA antibodies were tested (COVID-19 VIRCLIA Monotest, Vircell Microbiologist, Spain; reported sensitivity 70\% IgG and 89\% IgM/IgA, and specificity 89\% and 99\% respectively). Indeterminate results were re-tested (VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV2 Total Tests, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, USA; 100\% sensitivity and specificity) and re-classified as positive or negative. Women with COVID-19 were diagnosed and managed according to standard protocols and guidelines3,4. Statistical differences were tested using the χ$^{\textrm{2}}$ test or Student t-test as appropriate (p\&lt;0.05). Results: A total of 125 of 874 women (14.3\%) were positive for either IgG or IgM/IgA SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 54/372 (14.5\%) in the first and 71/502 (14.1\%) in the third trimester. A total of 75/125 (60\%) reported no symptoms of COVID-19 in the past 2 months, whereas 44 (35.2\%) reported one or more symptoms, of which 31 (24.8\%) had at least 3 symptoms or anosmia and 8 (6.4\%) dyspnea. Overall, 7 women (5.6\%) were admitted for persistent fever despite paracetamol and dyspnea, of which 3 had signs of pneumonia on chest radiography. All 3 had criteria for severity (bilateral chest condensation, respiratory rate\&gt;30 and leukopenia) and required oxygen support but not critical care or mechanical ventilation, and they were all discharged well. The rates of symptomatic infection, hospital admission or dyspnea were significantly higher in third trimester women (Table and Figure). Discussion: The 14.3\% seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2 in pregnant women in this study was substantially larger than the contemporary rates of PCR positive cases (0.78\%) reported for women 20-40y in Barcelona. The data confirm that COVID-19 is asymptomatic in the majority of pregnant women6 and illustrate the value of seroprevalence studies to capture the high proportion of asymptomatic or mild infections. In this study, none of the 125 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection required critical care as compared to 9\% reported in cases diagnosed with PCR. However, the proportion of infections with symptoms or dyspnea was remarkably higher in the third trimester, and these results are in line with COVID-19 registries, reporting that 81\% of hospitalized women were in late pregnancy or peripartum. These results provide reassuring information that, even in settings with a high prevalence, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy mostly presents with asymptomatic or mild clinical forms. The susceptibility to infection seemed to be the same in the first and the third trimesters of gestation. The data further suggest that, as with other respiratory viruses, COVID-19 could be more severe and require increased surveillance in late pregnancy. These findings should be confirmed and extended with larger consecutive prevalence studies in pregnancy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods: Data were retrospective collected from adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital. We described the clinical features and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding of patients with COVID-19 and evaluated factors associated with prolonged virus shedding by multivariate regression analysis. Results: Among 238 patients, the median age was 55.5 years, 57.1\% were female, 92.9\% (221/238) used arbidol, 58.4\% (139/238) used arbidol combination with interferon. The median time from illness onset to start arbidol was 8 days (IQR, 5-14 days) and the median duration of SARS-CoV-2 virus shedding was 23 days (IQR, 17.8-30 days). SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance was significantly delayed in patients who received arbidol \&gt;7 days after illness onset, compared with those in whom arbidol treatment was started less than or equal to7 days after illness onset (HR, 1.738 [95\% CI, 1.339-2.257], P \&lt; .001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that prolonged viral shedding was significantly associated with initiation arbidol more than seven days after symptom onset (OR 2.078, 95\% CI [1.114-3.876], P .004), more than 7 days from onset of symptoms to first medical visitation (OR 3.321, 95\% CI[1.559-7.073], P .002), illness onset before Jan.31, 2020 (OR 3.223, 95\% CI[1.450-7.163], P .021). Arbidol combination with interferon was also significantly associated with shorter virus shedding (OR .402, 95\% CI[.206-.787], P .008). Conclusions: Early initiation of arbidol and arbidol combination with interferon as well as consulting doctor timely after illness onset were helpful for SARS-CoV-2 clearance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Introduction  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a communicable disease caused by a novel coronavirus.
Objectives  This study aimed to assess self­‑reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders in nonhospitalized patients with COVID­‑19 in Poland. Patients and methods  This cross­‑sectional survey was conducted between April 17 and 18, 2020, in 4516 nonhospitalized patients with COVID­‑19 in Poland. The questionnaire included 8 questions related to the health status, symptoms of COVID­‑19, comorbidities, and smoking status.
Results  Completed questionnaires were obtained from 1942 patients with COVID­‑19 with a response rate of 43\%. The median age of the respondents was 50 years; 60.2\% were women. Among nonhospitalized patients with COVID­‑19, 21.3\% had hypertension, 4.5\% had diabetes, and 3.1\% had a chronic respiratory disease. Regular tobacco use was declared by 11.2\% of patients with COVID­‑19. At least one gastrointestinal symptom was reported by 53.6\% of patients. Almost half of patients (47\%) with COVID­‑19 reported lack of appetite and 24.2\% reported diarrhea. Among 1942 interviewed patients, 54.2\% reported at least 1 olfactory or taste disorder and 42.5\% reported both alterations. Self­‑reported olfactory and taste disorders were 49.2\% and 47.5\%, respectively. Self­‑reported frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders during COVID­‑19 was significantly higher (P {\textless}0.001) in women than men.
Conclusions  This study demonstrated that olfactory and taste disorders are frequent symptoms in patients with mild­‑to­‑moderate COVID­‑19. Moreover, our study indicated sex differences in the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and olfactory or taste disorders among non­hospitalized patients with COVID­‑19.},

	abstract = {Objective In this study, we report a large family cluster consisting of 29 genetically related patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We sought to determine the clinical characteristics relevant to the clinical course of COVID-19 by comparing the family cluster to unrelated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection so that the presence of potential determinants of disease severity, other than traditional risk factors previously reported, could be investigated. Methods 29 patient files were investigated in Group 1 and Group 2 was created with 52 consecutive COVID-19 patients with age and gender compatibility. The virus was detected for diagnosis. The clinical, laboratory and imaging features of all patients were retrospectively screened. Disease course was assessed using records regarding outcome from patient files retrospectively. Groups were compared with respect to baseline characteristics, disease severity on presentation, disease course. Results There was no difference between the two groups in terms of comorbidity and smoking history. In terms of in-hospital treatment, use differed not significantly between two groups. We found that all 29 patients in Group 1 had severe pneumonia, 18 patients had severe pneumonia. Hospitalization rates, length of hospital stay and transferred to ICU were found to be statistically significantly higher in Group 1. Conclusion In the present study, COVID-19 cases in the large family cluster were shown to have more severe disease and worse clinical course compared to consecutive COVID-19 patients presenting to the same time. We believe further studies into potential genetic mechanisms of host susceptibility to COVID-19 should include such family clusters. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Although cardiovascular disease has been associated with an increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no studies have reported its clinical course in patients with aortic stenosis who had undergone transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Several observational studies have found an association between the A blood group and an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas the O blood group appears to be protective. Objective: To investigate the frequency and clinical course of COVID-19 in a large sample of patients who had undergone TAVR and to determine the associations of the ABO blood group with disease occurrence and outcomes. Methods: Patients who had undergone TAVR between 2010 and 2019 were included in this study and followed-up through the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The main outcomes were the occurrence and severity (hospitalization and/or death) of COVID-19 and their association with the ABO blood group. Results: Of the 1125 patients who had undergone TAVR, 403 (36\%) died before January 1, 2020, and 20 (1.8\%) were lost to follow-up. The study sample therefore consisted of 702 patients. Among them, we identified 22 cases (3.1\%) with COVID-19. Fourteen patients (63.6\%) were hospitalized or died of disease. Multivariate analysis identified the A blood group (versus others) as the only independent predictor of COVID-19 in patients who had undergone TAVR (odds ratio [OR] = 6.32; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.11−18.92; p=0.001). The A blood group (versus others; OR = 8.27; 95\% CI = 1.83−37.43, p=0.006) and a history of cancer (OR = 4.99; 95\% CI = 1.64−15.27, p = 0.005) were significantly and independently associated with disease severity (hospitalization and/or death). Conclusions: Patients who had undergone TAVR are vulnerable to COVID-19. The subgroup with the A blood group was especially prone to develop the disease and showed unfavorable outcomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Importance: Blacks/African-Americans are overrepresented in the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths. Reasons for this disparity have not been well-characterized but may be due to underlying comorbidities or sociodemographic factors. Objective: To systematically determine patient characteristics associated with racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Design: A retrospective cohort study with comparative control groups. Setting: Patients tested for COVID-19 at University of Michigan Medicine from March 10, 2020 to April 22, 2020. Participants: 5,698 tested patients and two sets of comparison groups who were not tested for COVID-19: randomly selected unmatched controls (n = 7,211) and frequency-matched controls by race, age, and sex (n = 13,351). Main Outcomes and Measures: We identified factors associated with testing and testing positive for COVID-19, being hospitalized, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality (in/out-patient during the time frame). Factors included race/ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol consumption, healthcare utilization, and residential-level socioeconomic characteristics (SES; i.e., education, unemployment, population density, and poverty rate). Medical comorbidities were defined from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and were aggregated into a comorbidity score. Results: Of 5,698 patients, (median age, 47 years; 38\% male; mean BMI, 30.1), the majority were non-Hispanic Whites (NHW, 59.2\%) and non-Hispanic Black/African-Americans (NHAA, 17.2\%). Among 1,119 diagnosed, there were 41.2\% NHW and 37.4\% NHAA; 44.8\% hospitalized, 20.6\% admitted to ICU, and 3.8\% died. Adjusting for age, sex, and SES, NHAA were 1.66 times more likely to be hospitalized (95\% CI, 1.09-2.52; P=.02), 1.52 times more likely to enter ICU (95\% CI, 0.92-2.52; P=.10). In addition to older age, male sex and obesity, high population density neighborhood (OR, 1.27 associated with one SD change [95\% CI, 1.20-1.76]; P=.02) was associated with hospitalization. Pre-existing kidney disease led to 2.55 times higher risk of hospitalization (95\% CI, 1.62-4.02; P\&lt;.001) in the overall population and 11.9 times higher mortality risk in NHAA (95\% CI, 2.2-64.7, P=.004). Conclusions and Relevance: Pre-existing type II diabetes/kidney diseases and living in high population density areas were associated with high risk for COVID-19 susceptibility and poor prognosis. Association of risk factors with COVID-19 outcomes differed by race. NHAA patients were disproportionately affected by obesity and kidney disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide. A large proportion of COVID-19 patients with chronic underlying complications have been reported to be in severe condition and show unpromising clinical outcomes. But whether chronic comorbidities are risk factors affecting the severity of COVID-19 has not been well described. Methods We included COVID-19 patients who had been admitted to Tongji Hospital, Tongji medical college of HUST (Wuhan, China) from January, 27, 2020 to March, 8, 2020 in this retrospective cohort study. The final date of follow-up was March, 30, 2020. All patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 according to Prevention and control Scheme for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia published by National Health Commission of the People9 s Republic of China and WHO interim. Demographic data, medical history, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography (CT), treatment and clinical outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records with standardized data collection forms and compared among different groups. Results 1031 COVID-19 inpatients were included in this study, of whom 866 were discharged and 165 were dead in hospital. 73\% of 165 dead patients had complicated chronic comorbidities. Of the 1031 patients, 514 (50\%) were combined with chronic comorbidities, and showed CFR 2.8 times as that of patients without any underlying disease. The number of patients with hypertension accounted for three fourths of those with concomitant underlying diseases. The univariable regression revealed that patients in the simple hypertension group showed overall risk higher than those in the simple diabetes mellitus group. In the age-grouped research, patients in the hypertension senile group were proved to be at the highest risk, which might be associated with the level of LDH and eGFR. In this retrospective cohort study, 166 (43\%) patients with hypertension took CCB during the hospitalization, the odds ratio of CFR in patients with hypertension taking CCB group was 0.68 (P = 0.155), compared to those not. Conclusion Our data shows that the clinical manifestations of most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are actually systemic syndromes, although COVID-19 is defined as novel coronavirus pneumonia in China. Hypertension is not just a chronic underlying comorbidity, but also a risk factor affecting the severity of COVID-19 and does play a critical role in improving patients9 clinical outcomes. Therefore, hypertension management in patients with COVID-19 should be a major challenge in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, including optimal management of blood pressure and pathophysiological status.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives: To investigate SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) infection and exposure risks among grocery retail workers, and to investigate their mental health state during the pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020 in a single grocery retail store in Massachusetts, USA. We assessed workers personal/occupational history and perception of COVID-19 by questionnaire. The health outcomes were measured by nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results, GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) and PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Results: Among 104 workers tested, twenty-one (20\%) had positive viral assays. Seventy-six percent positive cases were asymptomatic. After multi-variate adjustments, employees with direct customer exposure had an odds of 4.7 (95\% CI 1.2 to 32.0) being tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while smokers had an odds of 0.1 (95\% CI 0.01 to 0.8) having positive assay. As to mental health, the prevalence of anxiety and depression (i.e. GAD-7 score \&gt; 4 or PHQ-9 score \&gt;4) was 24\% and 8\%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had odds of 0.2 (95\% CI 0.1 to 0.7) and 0.1 (95\% CI 0.01 to 0.6) screening positive for anxiety and depression, respectively. Conclusions: We found a considerable asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among grocery workers. Employees with direct costumer exposure were 5 times more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2, while cigarette smokers were 90\% less likely to have positive assays. Those able to practice social distancing consistently at work had significantly lower risk of anxiety or depression.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract Importance: No therapy to date has been shown to improve survival for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Ivermectin has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro but clinical response has not been previously evaluated. Objective: To determine whether Ivermectin is associated with lower mortality rate in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Design and Setting: Retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients hospitalized at four Broward Health hospitals in South Florida with confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Enrollment dates were March 15, 2020 through May 11, 2020. Follow up data for all outcomes was May 19, 2020. Participants: 280 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean age 59.6 years [standard deviation 17.9], 45.4\% female), of whom 173 were treated with ivermectin and 107 were usual care were reviewed. 27 identified patients were not reviewed due to multiple admissions, lack of confirmed COVID results during hospitalization, age less than 18, pregnancy, or incarceration. Exposure: Patients were categorized into two treatment groups based on whether they received at least one dose of ivermectin at any time during the hospitalization. Treatment decisions were at the discretion of the treating physicians. Severe pulmonary involvement at study entry was characterized as need for either FiO2 ≥50\%, or noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included subgroup mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement and extubation rates for patients requiring invasive ventilation. Results: Univariate analysis showed lower mortality in the ivermectin group (25.2\% versus 15.0\%, OR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.29-0.96, P=.03). Mortality was also lower among 75 patients with severe pulmonary disease treated with ivermectin (38.8\% vs 80.7\%, OR 0.15, CI 0.05-0.47, P=.001), but there was no significant difference in successful extubation rates (36.1\% vs 15.4\%, OR 3.11 (0.88-11.00), p=.07). After adjustment for between-group differences and mortality risks, the mortality difference remained significant for the entire cohort (OR 0.27, CI 0.09-0.85, p=.03; HR 0.37, CI 0.19-0.71, p=.03). Conclusions and Relevance: Ivermectin was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19, especially in patients who required higher inspired oxygen or ventilatory support. These findings should be further evaluated with randomized controlled trials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Importance: New York City is a global epicenter for the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak with a significant number of individuals infected by the virus. Patients with multiple myeloma have a compromised immune system, due to both the disease and anti-myeloma therapies, and may therefore be particularly susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, there is limited information to guide clinical management. Objective: To assess risk factors and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with multiple myeloma. Design: Case-series. Setting: Five large academic centers in New York City. Participants: Patients with multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 10th, 2020 and April 30th, 2020. Exposures: Clinical features and risk factors were analyzed in relation to severity of COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Descriptive statistics as well as logistic regression were used to estimate disease severity reflected in hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: Of 100 multiple myeloma patients (male 58\%; median age 68, range 41-91) diagnosed with COVID-19, 74 (74\%) were admitted; of these 13 (18\%) patients were placed on mechanical ventilation, and 18 patients (24\%) expired. None of the studied risk factors were significantly associated (P\&gt;0.05) with adverse outcomes (ICU-admission, mechanical ventilation, or death): hypertension (N=56) odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-5.9); diabetes (N=18) OR 1.1 (95\% CI 0.3-3.2); age \&gt;65 years (N=63) OR 2.0 (95\% CI 0.8-5.3); high dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplant \&lt;12 months (N=7) OR 1.2 (95\% CI 0.2-7.4), IgG\&lt;650 mg/dL (N=42) OR=1.2 (95\% CI 0.4-3.1). In the entire series of 127 patients with plasma cell disorders, hypertension was significantly associated with the combined end-point (OR 3.4, 95\% CI 1.5-8.1). Conclusions and Relevance: Although multiple myeloma patients have a compromised immune system due to both the disease and therapy; in this largest disease specific cohort to date of patients with multiple myeloma and COVID-19, compared to the general population, we found risk factors for adverse outcome to be shared and mortality rates to be within the higher range of officially reported mortality rates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background Frailty and multimorbidity have been suggested as risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. Aims We investigated whether frailty and multimorbidity were associated with risk of hospitalisation with COVID-19 in the UK Biobank. Methods 502,640 participants aged 40-69 years at baseline (54-79 years at COVID-19 testing) were recruited across UK 2006-10. A modified assessment of frailty using Fried9s classification was generated from baseline data. COVID-19 test results (England) were available 16/03/2020-01/06/2020, mostly taken in hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to discern associations between frailty, multimorbidity and COVID-19 diagnoses, adjusting for sex, age, BMI, ethnicity, education, smoking and number of comorbidity groupings, comparing COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Results 4,510 participants were tested for COVID-19 (positive=1,326, negative=3,184). 497,996 participants were not tested. Compared to the non-tested group, after adjustment, COVID-19 positive participants were more likely to be frail (OR=1.3 [95\% CI=1.1, 1.7]), report slow walking speed (OR=1.3 [1.1, 1.6]), report two or more falls in the past year (OR=1.3 [1.0, 1.5]) and be multimorbid (≥4 comorbidity groupings vs 0-1: OR=1.9 [1.5, 2.3]). However, similar strength of associations were apparent when comparing COVID-19 negative and non-tested groups. Furthermore, frailty and multimorbidity were not associated with COVID-19 diagnoses, when comparing COIVD-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants. Discussion and conclusions Frailty and multimorbidity do not appear to aid risk stratification, in terms of a positive versus negative results of COVID-19 testing. Investigation of the prognostic value of these markers for adverse clinical sequelae following COVID-19 disease is urgently needed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The United States (US) has not been spared in the ongoing pandemic of novel coronavirus disease. COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to cause death and disease in all 50 states, as well as significant economic damage wrought by the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) adopted in attempts to control transmission. We use a deterministic, Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Recovered (SEIR) compartmental framework to model possible trajectories of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the impact of NPI at the state level. Model performance was tested against reported deaths from 01 February to 04 July 2020. Using this SEIR model and projections of critical driving covariates (pneumonia seasonality, mobility, testing rates, and mask use per capita), we assessed some possible futures of the COVID-19 pandemic from 05 July through 31 December 2020. We explored future scenarios that included feasible assumptions about NPIs including social distancing mandates (SDMs) and levels of mask use. The range of infection, death, and hospital demand outcomes revealed by these scenarios show that action taken during the summer of 2020 will have profound public health impacts through to the year end. Encouragingly, we find that an emphasis on universal mask use may be sufficient to ameliorate the worst effects of epidemic resurgences in many states. Masks may save as many as 102,795 (55,898-183,374) lives, when compared to a plausible reference scenario in December. In addition, widespread mask use may markedly reduce the need for more socially and economically deleterious SDMs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Objective: To evaluate the rate of daily smokers in patients with COVID-19. Methods: COVID-19 in-and outpatients from a large French university hospital were systematically interviewed for their smoking status, use of e-cigarette and nicotinic substitutes. The rates of daily smokers in in-and outpatients were compared to those in the 2019 French general population, after standardization for sex and age. Results: The inpatient group was composed of 340 patients, median age 66 years: 203 men (59.7\%) and 137 women (40.3\%), median age for both 66 years, with a daily smokers rate of 4.1 \% CI95\% [2.3-6.9] (5.4\% of men, 2.2\% of women). The outpatient group was composed of 139 patients, median age 44 years: 62 men (44.6\%, median age 43 years), and 77 women (55.4\%, median age 44 years). The daily smoker rate was 6.1 \% CI 95\% [2.7-11.6] (5.1\% of men, 6.8\% of women). In the 2019 French population, the daily smoker rate was 24.0\% (27.5\% of men, 20.7\% of women). Among inpatients, daily smokers represented 2.2\% and 3.4\% of the 45 dead patients and of the 29 patients transferred to ICU, respectively.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND: It is now well recognised that the risk of severe COVID-19 increases with some long-term conditions (LTCs). However, prior research primarily focuses on individual LTCs and there is a lack of data on the influence of multimorbidity (≥2 LTCs) on the risk of COVID-19. Given the high prevalence of multimorbidity, more detailed understanding of the associations with multimorbidity and COVID-19 would improve risk stratification and help protect those most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Here we examine the relationships between multimorbidity, polypharmacy (a proxy of multimorbidity), and COVID-19; and how these differ by sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological prognostic factors. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We studied data from UK Biobank (428,199 participants; aged 37-73; recruited 2006-2010) on self-reported LTCs, medications, sociodemographic, lifestyle, and physiological measures which were linked to COVID-19 test data. Poisson regression models examined risk of COVID-19 by multimorbidity/polypharmacy and effect modification by COVID-19 prognostic factors (age/sex/ethnicity/socioeconomic status/smoking/physical activity/BMI/systolic blood pressure/renal function). 4,498 (1.05\%) participants were tested; 1,324 (0.31\%) tested positive for COVID-19. Compared with no LTCs, relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 in those with 1 LTC was no higher (RR 1.12 (CI 0.96-1.30)), whereas those with ≥2 LTCs had 48\% higher risk; RR 1.48 (1.28-1.71). Compared with no cardiometabolic LTCs, having 1 and ≥2 cardiometabolic LTCs had a higher risk of COVID-19; RR 1.28 (1.12-1.46) and 1.77 (1.46-2.15), respectively. Polypharmacy was associated with a dose response increased risk of COVID-19. All prognostic factors were associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection in multimorbidity; being non-white, most socioeconomically deprived, BMI ≥40 kg/m2, and reduced renal function were associated with the highest risk of COVID-19 infection: RR 2.81 (2.09-3.78); 2.79 (2.00-3.90); 2.66 (1.88-3.76); 2.13 (1.46-3.12), respectively. No multiplicative interaction between multimorbidity and prognostic factors was identified. Important limitations include the low proportion of UK Biobank participants with COVID-19 test data (1.05\%) and UK Biobank participants being more affluent, healthier and less ethnically diverse than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing multimorbidity, especially cardiometabolic multimorbidity, and polypharmacy are associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19. Those with multimorbidity and additional factors, such as non-white ethnicity, are at heightened risk of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: New York City is the US epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Early international data indicated that comorbidity contributes significantly to poor prognosis and fatality in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. It is not known to what degree medical comorbidity and sociodemographic determinants impact COVID-19 mortality in the US. Methods: Evaluation of de-identified electronic health records of 7,592 COVID-19 patients confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 lab tests in New York City. Medical comorbidites and outcome of mortality, and other covariates, including clinical, sociodemographic, and medication measures were assessed by bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Of common comorbid conditions (hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, obesity, diabetes, HIV, cancer), when adjusted for covariates, chronic kidney disease remained significantly associated with increased odds of mortality. Patients who had more than one comorbidities, former smokers, treated with Azithromycin without Hydroxychloroquine, reside within the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens Higher had higher odds of death. Conclusions: Increasing numbers of comorbid factors increase COVID-19 mortality, but several clinical and sociodemographic factors can mitigate risk. Continued evaluation of COVID-19 in large diverse populations is important to characterize individuals at risk and improve clinical outcomes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This study analyzed obesity as an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients younger than fifty. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data of COVID-19 patients hospitalized to a large academic hospital system in New York City between March 1st and May 17th, 2020. Data included demographics, comorbidities, BMI and smoking status. Obesity groups included: BMI 30–40 kg/m2 and BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2. Multivariable logistic regression models identified variables independently associated with mortality in patients younger and older than 50. Results Overall, 3,406 patients were included. 572 (17.0\%) of the patients were younger than 50. In the younger age group, 60 (10.5\%) patients died. In the older age group, 1,076 (38.0\%) patients died. For the younger population, BMI above 40 kg/m2 was independently associated with mortality (aOR 5.1, 95\% CI 2.3–11.1). For the older population, BMI above 40 kg/m2 was also independently associated with mortality to a lesser extent (aOR 1.6, 95\% CI 1.2 – 2.3). Conclusion Our study demonstrates that hospitalized patients younger than 50 with morbid obesity are more likely to die from COVID-19. This is particularly relevant in the western world where obesity rates are high.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that emerged in Wuhan city has spread rapidly around the world. The risk for poor outcome dramatically increases once a patient progresses to the severe or critical stage. The present study aims to investigate the risk factors for disease progression in individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19.
Methods: We conducted a cohort study that included 1007 individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19 from three hospitals in Wuhan. Clinical characteristics and baseline laboratory ﬁndings were collected. Patients were followed up for 28 days for observation of disease progression. The end point was the progression to a more severe disease stage.
Results: During a follow up of 28 days, 720 patients (71.50\%) had recovered or were symptomatically stable, 222 patients (22.05\%) had progressed to severe disease, 22 patients (2.18\%) had progressed to the critically ill stage and 43 patients (4.27\%) had died. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models identiﬁed that increased age (hazard ratio (HR) 2.56, 95\% CI 1.97e3.33), male sex (HR 1.79, 95\% CI 1.41 e2.28), presence of hypertension (HR 1.44, 95\% CI 1.11e1.88), diabetes (HR 1.82, 95\% CI 1.35e2.44), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.01, 95\% CI 1.38e2.93) and coronary artery disease (HR 1.83, 95\% CI 1.26e2.66) were risk factors for disease progression. History of smoking was protective against disease progression (HR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.34e0.91). Elevated procalcitonin (HR 1.72, 95\% CI 1.02e2.90), urea nitrogen (HR 1.72, 95\% CI 1.21e2.43), a-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HR 3.02, 95\% CI 1.26e7.21) and D-dimer (HR 2.01, 95\% CI 1.12e3.58) at baseline were also associated with risk for disease progression.
Conclusions: This study identiﬁed a panel of risk factors for disease progression in individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19. Y. Cen, Clin Microbiol Infect 2020;▪:1 © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background The novel coronavirus has become a global threat and healthcare concern. The manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in transplant patients are not well understood and may have more severe symptoms, longer duration, and a worse prognosis than in immunocompetent populations. This study proposed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. Methods Clinical records, laboratory results, radiological characteristics, and clinical outcome of 24 kidney transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated from March 20 to May 20, 2020. Results The most common symptom was shortness of breath (70.8\%), followed by fever (62.5\%) and cough (45.8\%). Five patients had leukopenia, and only one patient had leukocytosis, while 75\% of the patients had a white blood cell (WBC) count in the normal range, and 79\% of recipients developed lymphopenia. All of the patients had an elevated concentration of C-reactive protein and an increase in blood urea levels. Chest CT images of 23 patients (95.8\%) showed typical findings of patchy ground-glass shadows in the lungs. Of the 24 patients, 12 were admitted to ICU (invasive care unit), and ten of 24 patients (41.6\%) died, and 14 patients were discharged after complete recovery. Conclusion It seems that COVID-19 is more severe in transplant patients and has poorer outcomes. Multiple underlying diseases, low O2 saturation, and Multi lobar view in chest C.T. scan may be of prognostic value. However, many SARS-COV-2 demonstrations are similar to those of the general population.},

	abstract = {After months of restrictive containment efforts to fight the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, European countries are planning to reopen. To support the process, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among the Hungarian population to estimate the prevalence of infectious cases and prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. A representative sample (n = 17,787) for the Hungarian population of 14 years or older living in private households (n = 8,283,810) was selected. The study was performed within 16 days after 50 days of restrictions, when the number of confirmed cases was stable low. Naso- and oropharyngeal smears and blood samples were collected for PCR and antibody testing. The testing was accompanied by a questionnaire about symptoms, comorbidities, and contacts. Design-based prevalence estimates were calculated. In total, 10,474 individuals (67.7\% taken into account a sample frame error of 2315) of the selected sample participated in the survey. Of the tested individuals, 3 had positive PCR and 69 had positive serological test. Population estimate of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity were 2421 and 56,439, respectively, thus active infection rate (2.9/10,000) and the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure (68/10,000) was low. Self-reported loss of smell or taste and body aches were significantly more frequent among those with SARS-CoV-2. In this representative, cross-sectional survey of the Hungarian population with a high participation rate, the overall active infection rate was low in sync with the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We demonstrated a potential success of containment efforts, supporting an exit strategy. NCT04370067, 30.04.2020.},

	abstract = {Haematology patients receiving chemo- or immunotherapy are considered to be at greater risk of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. We aimed to identify risk factors for COVID-19 severity and assess outcomes in patients where COVID-19 complicated the treatment of their haematological disorder. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 55 patients with haematological disorders and COVID-19, including 52 with malignancy, 2 with bone marrow failure and 1 immune mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). COVID-19 diagnosis coincided with a new diagnosis of a haematological malignancy in four patients. 82\% of patients were on systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) at time of COVID-19. Of hospitalised patients, 37\% (19/51) died whilst all four outpatients recovered. Risk factors for severe disease or mortality were similar to other published cohorts. Raised CRP at diagnosis predicted an aggressive clinical course. The majority of patients recovered from COVID-19, despite receiving recent SACT. This suggests that SACT, where urgent, should be administered despite intercurrent CV19 infection, which should be managed according to standard pathway. Delay or modification of therapy should be considered on an individual basis. Long-term follow-up studies in larger patient cohorts are required to assess efficacy of treatment strategies employed during the pandemic.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Importance: Racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes have been amplified during this pandemic and reports on outcomes in African-American (AA) populations, known to have higher rates of cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities, remain limited. Objective: To examine prevalence of comorbidities, rates of hospitalization and survival, and incidence of CV manifestations of COVID-19 in a predominantly AA population in south metropolitan Chicago. Design, Setting, Participants: This was an observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients encountered from March 16 to April 16, 2020 at the University of Chicago. Deidentified data were obtained from an institutional data warehouse. Group comparisons and logistic regression modeling based on baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory and diagnostic testing was performed. Exposures: COVID-19 was diagnosed by nasopharyngeal swab testing and clinical management was at the discretion of treating physicians. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes were hospitalization and in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes included incident CV manifestations of COVID-19 in the context of overall cardiology service utilization. Results: During the 30 day study period, 1008 patients tested positive for COVID-19 and 689 had available encounter data. Of these, 596 (87\%) were AA and 356 (52\%) were hospitalized, of which 319 (90\%) were AA. Age \&gt; 60 years, tobacco use, BMI \&gt;40 kg/m2, diabetes mellitus (DM), insulin use, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease (CAD), and atrial fibrillation (AF) were more common in hospitalized patients. Age \&gt; 60 years, tobacco use, CAD, and AF were associated with greater risk of in-hospital mortality along with several elevated initial laboratory markers including troponin, NT-proBNP, blood urea nitrogen, and ferritin. Despite this, cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 were uncommon, coincident with a 69\% decrease in cardiology service utilization. For hospitalized patients, median length of stay was 6.2 days (3.4-11.9 days) and mortality was 13\%. AA patients were more commonly hospitalized, but without increased mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: In this AA-predominant experience from south metropolitan Chicago, CV comorbidities and chronic diseases were highly prevalent and associated with increased hospitalization and mortality. Insulin-requiring DM and CKD emerged as novel predictors for hospitalization. Despite the highest rate of comorbidities reported to date, CV manifestations of COVID-19 and mortality were relatively low. The unexpectedly low rate of mortality merits further study.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Cancer patients with COVID-19 are likely to have a greater risk of complications and death. A retrospective search in the electronic medical records of cancer inpatients admitted to the Brazilian National Cancer Institute from April 30, 2020 to May 26, 2020 granted identification of 181 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR method. The mean age was 55.3 years (SD 21.1). The most prevalent solid tumors were breast (40 [22.1\%]), gastrointestinal (24 [13.3\%]), and gynecological (22 [12.2\%]). Among hematological malignancies, lymphoma (20 [11\%]) and leukemia (10 [5.5\%]) predominated. The most common complications were respiratory failure (70 [38.7\%]), septic shock (40 [22.1\%]) and acute kidney injury (33 [18.2\%]). A total of 60 (33.1\%) patients died due to COVID-19 complications. By multivariate analysis, cases with admission due to symptoms of COVID-19 (p = 0.027) and with two or more metastatic sites (p \&lt;0.001) showed a higher risk of COVID-19-specific death. This is the first study in a cohort of Brazilian cancer patients with COVID-19. The rates of complications and COVID-19-specific death were significantly high.

	abstract = {Objective We compared the clinical characteristics, findings and outcomes of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or influenza to detect relevant differences. Methods From December 2019 to April 2020, we recruited all eligible hospitalized adults with respiratory infection to a prospective observational study at the HUS Jorvi Hospital, Finland. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. Follow-up lasted for at least 30 days from admission. Results We included 61 patients, of whom 28 were COVID-19 and 33 influenza patients with median ages of 53 and 56 years. Majority of both COVID-19 and influenza patients were men (61\% vs 67\%) and had at least one comorbidity (68\% vs 85\%). Pulmonary diseases and current smoking were less common among COVID-19 than influenza patients (5 [18\%] vs 15 [45\%], P=0.03 and 1 [4\%] vs 10 [30\%], P=0.008). In chest x-ray at admission, ground-glass opacities and consolidations were more frequent among COVID-19 than influenza patients (19 [68\%] and 7 [21\%], P {\textless} 0.001). Severe disease and intensive care unit (ICU) admission occurred more often among COVID-19 than influenza patients (26 [93\%] vs 19 [58\%], P=0.003 and 8 [29\%] vs 2 [6\%], P=0.034). COVID-19 patients were hospitalized longer than influenza patients (6 days [IQR 4-21] vs 3 [2-4], P{\textless}0.001). Conclusion Bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations in chest X-ray may help to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients had more severe disease, required longer hospitalization and were admitted to ICU more often than influenza patients, which has important implications for public health policies.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Clinical spectrum of COVID-19 has been unclear, especially with regard to the presence of pneumonia. We aimed to present clinical course of all laboratory-confirmed adult COVID-19 patients and to identify potential predicting factors of pneumonia. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study among adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute, Thailand, regardless of their disease severity, between January 8 and April 16, 2020. We described the full picture of COVID-19, defined definite outcomes and evaluated factors associated with pneumonia. Results: One-hundred-and-ninety-three patients were included. The median (IQR) age was 37.0 (29.0-53.0) years, and 58.5\% were male. Of whom, 189 (97.9\%) recovered and 4 (2.1\%) died. More than half (56\%) of the patients were mild, 22\% were moderate, 14\% were severe, and 3\% were critically ill. Asymptomatic infection was found in 5\%. The overall incidence of pneumonia was 39\%. Bilateral was more prevalent than unilateral pneumonia (65\% vs. 35\%). Increasing age (OR 2.60 for every 10-year increase from 30 years old; 95\% CI, 1.68 to 3.97; p\&lt;0.001), obesity (OR 9.17; 95\% CI, 2.11 to 39.89; p=0.003), and higher temperature at presentation (OR 4.66 per one-degree Celsius increase from 37.2 degree Celsius; 95\% CI, 2.32 to 9.34; p\&lt;0.001) were potential predicting factors of COVID-19 pneumonia. Severe cases had a longer viral RNA shedding duration than the non-severe cases. The longest observed duration of viral RNA shedding was 45 days. Conclusion: Across different disease severities, most patients with COVID-19 in Thailand had a good prognosis. COVID-19 pneumonia was found in one-third of the hospitalized patients. Potential predicting factors included old age, obesity, fever at presentation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan in December 2019 became a pandemic within a few months of its discovery. The impact of COVID-19 is due to both its rapid spread and its severity, but the determinants of severity have not been fully delineated. Objective: Identify factors associated with hospitalization and disease severity in a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: We analyzed data from COVID-19 patients diagnosed at the University of Cincinnati health system from March 13, 2020 to May 31, 2020. Severe COVID-19 was defined as admission to intensive care unit or death. Logistic regression modeling adjusted for covariates was used to identify the factors associated with hospitalization and severe COVID-19. Results: Among the 689 COVID-19 patients included in our study, 29.2\% were non-Hispanic White, 25.5\% were non-Hispanic Black, 32.5\% were Hispanic, and 12.8\% were of other race/ethnicity. About 31.3\% of patients were hospitalized and 13.2\% had severe disease. In adjusted analyses, the sociodemographic factors associated with hospitalization and/or disease severity included older age, non-Hispanic Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity (compared to non-Hispanic White), and smoking. The following comorbidities: diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, asthma, COPD, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, and vitamin D deficiency were associated with hospitalization and/or disease severity. Hematological disorders such as anemia, coagulation disorders, and thrombocytopenia were associated with both hospitalization and disease severity. Conclusion: This study confirms race and ethnicity as predictors of severe COVID-19. It also finds clinical risk factors for hospitalization and severe COVID-19 not previously identified such a vitamin D deficiency, hypercholesterolemia, osteoarthritis, and anemia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: The global SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused substantial worldwide mortality. At present, there is no data regarding oncologist-specific SARS-CoV-2 infection/immunity rates in the United Kingdom (UK) which might impact planning for the management of potentially immunosuppressed cancer patients. Here, we present the first results from the COVID-19 Serology in Oncology Staff (CSOS) study with the aim of informing non-surgical oncology management guidelines. Methods: Patient-facing staff working in an oncology department during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large district general hospital in the East of England were invited to participate. Samples were collected during the first week of June 2020: blood for SARS-COV-2 antibody testing using a rapid lateral flow point of care (POC) assay and a laboratory Luminex based assay, as well as a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Participant characteristics were also collected. Results: Seventy participants were recruited: nurses (45/70; 64.3\%), doctors (15/70; 21.2\%), and other patient-facing staff (10/70; 14.3\%). The majority were female (61/70; 87.1\%) with a mean age of 42 years (median 41; range 23-64 years). A minority were smokers (9/70; 10\%) or had chronic underlying health conditions (16/70; 22.9\%), the commonest being asthma. All participants were nasopharyngeal-swab PCR negative, although 4/70 (5.7\%) had previously tested positive by NHS testing undertaken during the preceding months. 15/70 (21.4\%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Luminex test. Nurses had the highest incidence of positive antibodies (13/45; 28.9\%), with a lower incidence in doctors (2/15; 13.3\%) although this difference was not statistically significant (Fischer9s exact test p=0.3). No receptionists had positive antibody tests. All four participants with a previously reported positive PCR test were antibody-positive. 9/15 (60\%) of antibody-positive participants reported previous symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a 3.6-fold higher odds than antibody-negative participants, of whom 16/55 reported symptoms (p=0.03). The mean duration of symptoms was 11 days (median 11; range 1-35 days) and the mean time from resolution of reported previous symptoms to antibody testing was 48.4 days (median 46; range 1-123 days). Conclusion: This study establishes the SARS-CoV-2 exposure and carriage rate amongst patient-facing staff working in the oncology department of a large UK general hospital during the pandemic. These results may help inform UK national oncology patient management prior to the development of a viable vaccine or treatment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: SARS-CoV-2 is currently causing a high mortality global pandemic. However, the clinical spectrum of disease caused by this virus is broad, ranging from asymptomatic infection to cytokine storm with organ failure and death. Risk stratification of individuals with COVID-19 would be desirable for management, prioritization for trial enrollment, and risk stratification. We sought to develop a prediction rule for mortality due to COVID-19 in individuals with diagnosed infection in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Data from the Ontario provincial iPHIS system were extracted for the period from January 23 to May 15, 2020. Both logistic regression-based prediction rules, and a rule derived using a Cox proportional hazards model, were developed in half the study and validated in remaining patients. Sensitivity analyses were performed with varying approaches to missing data. Results: 21,922 COVID-19 cases were reported. Individuals assigned to the derivation and validation sets were broadly similar. Age and comorbidities (notably diabetes, renal disease and immune compromise) were strong predictors of mortality. Four point-based prediction rules were derived (base case, smoking excluded as a predictor, long-term care excluded as a predictor, and Cox model based). All rules displayed excellent discrimination (AUC for all rules \&gt; 0.92 ) and calibration (both by graphical inspection and P \&gt; 0.50 by Hosmer-Lemeshow test) in the derivation set. All rules performed well in the validation set and were robust to random replacement of missing variables, and to the assumption that missing variables indicated absence of the comorbidity or characteristic in question. Conclusions: We were able to use a public health case-management data system to derive and internally validate four accurate, well-calibrated and robust clinical prediction rules for COVID-19 mortality in Ontario, Canada. While these rules need external validation, they may be a useful tool for clinical management, risk stratification, and clinical trials.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}IMPORTANCE: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections are potential sources for transmission; characterization of these cases has not been conducted in most low/middle income countries, including Mexico. OBJECTIVE: To profile pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in Mexico City, its associated comorbidities and outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective observational study SETTING: Subjects assessed by convenience sampling within the National Epidemiological Surveillance System in Mexico City. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with and without respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms (RS, NRS, respectively) assessed for SARS-CoV-2 using real time RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. OUTCOMES: Severe COVID-19, intensive care unit admission, 30-day mortality and their outcomes in cases RS or NRS and asymptomatic cases. RESULTS: Amongst 60121 cases with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection as of July 1st, 2020, we identified 5982 cases without RS (9.9\%) and 2452 who were asymptomatic at first evaluation (4.1\%). Compared to cases with RS, NRS and asymptomatic cases were younger and had lower rates of comorbidities. Cases with NRS had higher rates of severe COVID-19 outcomes including hospitalization, ICU admission, and intubation (p\&lt;0.001). Mortality was higher for cases with NRS (HR 3.13, 95\%CI 1.80-5.45) or RS (HR 7.58, 95\%CI 4.56-12.58) compared to asymptomatic cases, adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities. Predictors for mortality in cases without RS included older age, previous exposure to suspected viral infection cases, comorbidities, presence of NRS and vomiting. For asymptomatic SARS-Co-V-2 infections, chronic kidney disease, previous exposure with suspected infection cases and older age were predictors for lethality. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Definition of pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic cases has relevant implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes. Older age and comorbidity impact on the probability of developing severe complications for cases who were asymptomatic or had only NRS at evaluation and were sent for domiciliary treatment. Extending testing for detection of asymptomatic cases must be considered in Mexico to better understand the impact of the pandemic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Six patients were included (5 men) with a mean age of 65.8 years (range, 55–78 years). COVID-19 was diagnosed by detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 in 5 patients and was presumed due to typical clinical and imaging findings in 1 patient. All patients had vascular risk factors including diabetes (83\%), hyperlipidemia (100\%), and smoking (17\%). Four patients presented with large infarcts with initial NIHSS scores of 24–30. During their hospitalization, all patients had elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels, 5 patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels, 3 had elevated interleukin-6 levels, and 2 had elevated troponin levels. Inflammation related to COVID-19 may result in rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in thrombosis and acute ischemic stroke.},

Several response distributions are supported, of which all parameters (e.g., location, scale, and shape) can be predicted at the same time thus allowing for distributional regression. Non-linear relationships may be specified using non-linear predictor terms or semi-parametric approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. To make all of these modeling options possible in a multilevel framework, brms provides an intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known formula syntax of lme4. The purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax in detail and to demonstrate its usefulness with four examples, each showing other relevant aspects of the syntax.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The first officially registered case of COVID-19 in Brazil was on February 26, 2020. Since then, the situation has worsened with more than 672,000 confirmed cases and at least 36,000 reported deaths at the time of this writing. Accurate diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 is extremely important to offer adequate treatment, and avoid overloading the healthcare system. Characteristics of patients such as age, comorbidities and varied clinical symptoms can help in classifying the level of infection severity, predict the disease outcome and the need for hospitalization. Here, we present a study to predict a poor prognosis in positive COVID-19 patients and possible outcomes using machine learning. The study dataset comprises information of 13,690 patients concerning closed cases due to cure or death. Our experimental results show the disease outcome can be predicted with a ROC AUC of 0.92, Sensitivity of 0.88 and Specificity of 0.82 for the best prediction model. This is a preliminary retrospective study which can be improved with the inclusion of further data. Conclusion: Machine learning techniques fed with demographic and clinical data along with comorbidities of the patients can assist in the prognostic prediction and physician decision-making, allowing a faster response and contributing to the non-overload of healthcare systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective To describe the efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion for COVID-19 patients. Methods This is a retrospective study of 6 COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma at Guizhou Provincial Jiangjunshan Hospital ─ a tertial hospital, in Guiyang, Guizhou, China, from January 29, to April 30, 2020; final data of follow-up was May 12, 2020. Through the review of the electronic medical records of Guizhou Jiangjunshan Hospital, clinical data of 6 patients were obtained. Three patients with worsening symptoms after empirical treatment with antivirals were transfused convalescent plasma therapy for the first treatment, while the other three severe or critical COVID-19 patients with rapid progression were transfused. The efficacy of convalescent plasma depends on the relief of symptoms, changes in laboratory indicators and chest imaging abnormalities. Results The PaO2 / FiO2 and lymphocyte count of patients 1, 2 and 3 treated with convalescent plasma treatment for the first treatment period were changed from abnormal to normal. The levels of inflammation markers CRP and IL-6 of the patients decreased significantly. Chest imaging examination showed that the lung lesions gradually subsided. The relapsed patients (No. 4 and No. 6), after using convalescent plasma therapy, turned negative on two consecutive throat swab tests on Day 24 and Day 3, respectively. Conclusions Convalescent plasma treatment of COVID-19 is beneficial for those patients with be difficult to turn to negative or re-positive RT-PCR.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 relies on the transfer of anti-viral antibody from donors to recipients via plasma transfusion. The relationship between clinical characteristics and antibody response to COVID-19 is not well defined. We investigated predictors of convalescent antibody production and quantified recipient antibody response in a convalescent plasma therapy clinical trial. Methods: Multivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID-19. Results: Mean symptom duration of plasma donors was 11.9 and 7.8\% (8/103) had been hospitalized. Antibody titers ranged from 0 to 1:3,892 (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1:3,289 (anti-spike). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that higher anti-RBD and anti-spike titer were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID-19, fever, and absence of myalgia (all p\&lt;0.05). Fatigue was significantly associated with anti-RBD (p=0.03) but not anti-spike antibody titer (p=0.11). In pairwise comparison among ABO blood types, AB donors had higher anti-RBD titer than O negative donors (p=0.048) and higher anti-spike titer than O negative (p=0.015) or O positive (p=0.037) donors. Eight of the ten recipients were discharged, one remains on ECMO and one died on ECMO. No toxicity was associated with plasma transfusion. After excluding two ECMO patients and adjusting for donor antibody titer, recipient anti-RBD antibody titer increased on average 31\% per day during the first three days post-transfusion (p=0.01) and anti-spike antibody titer by 40.3\% (p=0.02). Conclusion: Advanced age, fever, absence of myalgia, fatigue, blood type and hospitalization were associated with higher convalescent antibody titer to COVID-19. Despite variability in donor titer, 80\% of convalescent plasma recipients showed significant increase in antibody levels post-transfusion. A more complete understanding of the dose-response effect of plasma transfusion among COVID-19 patients is needed to determine the clinical efficacy of this therapy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background England has experienced one of the highest rates of confirmed COVID-19 mortality in the world. SARS-CoV-2 virus has circulated in hospitals, care homes and the community since January 2020. Our current epidemiological knowledge is largely informed by clinical cases with far less understanding of community transmission. Methods The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study is a nationally representative prevalence survey of SARS-CoV-2 virus swab-positivity in the community in England. We recruited participants regardless of symptom status. Results We found 159 positives from 120,610 swabs giving an average prevalence of 0.13\% (95\% CI: 0.11\%,0.15\%) from 1st May to 1st June 2020. We showed decreasing prevalence with a halving time of 8.6 (6.2, 13.6) days, implying an overall reproduction number R of 0.57 (0.45, 0.72). Adults aged 18 to 24 yrs had the highest swab-positivity rates, while those \&gt;64 yrs had the lowest. Of the 126 participants who tested positive with known symptom status in the week prior to their swab, 39 reported symptoms while 87 did not, giving an estimate that 69\% (61\%,76\%) of people were symptom-free for the 7 days prior testing positive in our community sample. Symptoms strongly associated with swab-positivity were: nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhoea, blocked nose, loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, chills and severe fatigue. Recent contact with a known COVID-19 case was associated with odds of 24 (16, 38) for swab-positivity. Compared with non-key workers, odds of swab-positivity were 7.7 (2.4, 25) among care home (long-term care facilities) workers and 5.2 (2.9, 9.3) among health care workers. However, some of the excess risk associated with key worker status was explained by recent contact with COVID-19 cases. We found no strong evidence for geographical variability in positive swab results. Conclusion Our results provide a reliable baseline against which the impact of subsequent relaxation of lockdown can be assessed to inform future public health efforts to control transmission.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The effects of smoking on Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, considering the high-population smoking prevalence in China (26.6\%). A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed on April 1. Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found. The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were classified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified as current smokers. A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified. The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4\% (95\% CI 0.0–3.4\%) to 12.6\% (95\% CI 10.6–14.6\%). An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5\%, 95\% CI 4.9–8.2\%) as compared to population smoking prevalence in China. The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3\% (95\% CI 5.7–8.9\%). In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence. Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, an emergent zoonotic disease which has reached pandemic levels and is designated a public health emergency of international concern. It is plausible that former or current smoking status is associated with infection, hospitalisation and/or mortality from COVID-19. Objective: We aimed to estimate the association of smoking status with rates of i) infection, ii) hospitalisation, iii) disease severity, and iv) mortality from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 disease. Methods: This is a living evidence review with frequent updates. We adopted recommended practice for rapid evidence reviews, which involved limiting the search to main databases and having one reviewer extract data and another verify. Published articles and pre-prints were identified via Ovid MEDLINE, medRxiv and expertise within the review team. We included observational or experimental studies with community-dwelling or hospitalised adults aged 16+ years who had received a test for SARS-CoV-2 infection or a diagnosis of COVID-19, providing that data on smoking status were reported. Studies were judged as ‘good’ quality if they: i) had low levels of missing data on smoking status (i.e. {\textless}20\%) and used a reliable self-report measure that distinguished between current, former and never smoking status; AND ii) used biochemical verification of smoking status and reported results from adjusted analyses; OR reported data from a representative/random sample. Studies were rated as ‘fair’ if they fulfilled criterion i) only and were otherwise rated as ‘poor’. Results: Version 5 with searches up to 23 June 2020 included 148 studies, 43 of which were conducted in China, 37 in the US, 15 in the UK, nine in Mexico, nine in Spain, eight in France, six in Italy, five across multiple international sites, two in Israel, and one each from 14 further countries. Thirty-two (21.6\%) studies reported current, former and never smoking status. Twenty-six studies (17.6\%) explicitly reported the proportion missing data on smoking status, which ranged from 0.08\% to 96.4\%. Notwithstanding recording uncertainties, compared with adult national prevalence estimates, recorded current and former smoking rates were generally lower than expected. In 12 ‘fair’ quality studies, current smokers were at reduced risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with never smokers (RR = 0.70, 95\% CI = 0.55-0.88, p = .003, I2 = 90\%). No significant difference was observed between former and never smokers (RR = 1.02, 95\% CI = 0.92-1.12, p = .76, I2 = 72\%). In seven ‘fair’ quality studies, there was no significant difference between current and never (RR = 1.06, 95\% CI = 0.79-1.44, p = .63, I2 = 79\%) or former and never smokers (RR = 1.20, 95\% CI = 0.95-1.51, p = .10, I2 = 79\%) in the risk of requiring admission to hospital with COVID-19 among those testing positive in the community. In six ‘fair’ quality studies, no significant difference in disease severity was observed between current and never smokers (RR = 1.22, 95\% CI = 0.98-1.53, p = .08, I2 = 22\%). Former smokers were at increased risk of greater disease severity compared with never smokers (RR = 1.58, 95\% CI = 1.07-2.32, p = .02, I2 = 68\%). In five ‘fair’ quality studies, current (RR = 1.70, 95\% CI = 1.14-2.55, p = .01, I2 = 29\%) and former smokers (RR = 2.00, 95\% CI = 1.57-2.55, p {\textless} .0.001, I2 = 0\%) were at increased risk of in-hospital death compared with never smokers. Conclusions: Across 148 studies, there is substantial uncertainty about the associations of smoking with COVID-19 outcomes. The recorded smoking prevalence in the included studies was generally lower than overall adult national estimates. There was no evidence of reduced risk of admission to hospital for current compared with never smokers among those testing positive in the community. There was some evidence that current compared with never smoking is associated with reduced risk of testing positive in the community but also greater in-hospital mortality from COVID-19. There was some evidence that former compared with never smoking is associated with increased risk of greater disease severity and in-hospital mortality from COVID-19. Implications: Unrelated to COVID-19, smokers are at a greater risk of a range of serious health problems. Given uncertainty around the association of smoking with COVID-19 outcomes, smoking cessation remains a public health priority and high-quality smoking cessation advice including recommendations to use alternative nicotine products should form part of public health efforts during this pandemic. High quality, smoking-specific research is needed to resolve these mixed findings.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, an emergent zoonotic disease which has reached pandemic levels and is designated a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organisation. Early data suggest that older age, male sex and a diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes independently increase the risk of hospitalisation and death from COVID-19; however, the biological mechanisms underpinning these associations are currently unclear. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters human cells through the ACE2 receptor. Current and past tobacco smoking is associated with changes in the ACE2 receptor expression, hypertension, diabetes and worse outcomes following other viral infections. It is hence plausible that smoking is an independent risk factor for hospitalisation and death from COVID-19. Here, we review available evidence for an association between smoking status and hospitalisation for COVID-19. We highlight concerns regarding the quality of available data and call for more systematic collection of smoking status in future studies.},

We conducted this retrospective cohort study to identify the risk factors associated with morbidity and mortality outcomes with a cohort of 1016 COVID-19 patients diagnosed in May 2020. Data were collected by telephone-interview and reviewing records using a questionnaire and checklist. Morbidity (64.4\% Vs. 6.0\%) and mortality (2.3\% Vs. 2.5\%) outcomes varied between the 14th and 28th day. Morbidity risk factors included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (RR=1.19, RR=2.68) both on the 14th and 18th day while elderly (AOR=2.56) and smokeless tobacco (SLT) (AOR=2.17) on the 28th day. Mortality risk factors included elderly (AOR=10.14), COPD (RR=5.93), and SLT (AOR=2.25) on the 14th day, and elderly (AOR=24.37) and COPD (RR=2.72) on the 28th day. The morbidity risk was higher with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (RR=3.33) and chronic liver disease (CLD) (RR=3.99) on the 28th day. The mortality risk was higher with coronary heart disease (RR=4.54) and CLD (RR=9.66) on the 14th while with diabetes mellitus (RR=3.08, RR=2.08), hypertension (RR=3.14, RR=2.30), CKD (RR=8.97, RR=2.71), and malignant diseases (RR=10.29) on both 14th and 28th day.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective To compare survival of subjects with COVID-19 treated in hospitals that either did or did not routinely treat patients with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. Methods We analysed data of COVID-19 patients treated in 9 hospitals in the Netherlands. Inclusion dates ranged from February 27th 2020, to May 15th, when the Dutch national guidelines no longer supported the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine. Seven hospitals routinely treated subjects with (hydroxy)chloroquine, two hospitals did not. Primary outcome was 21-day all-cause mortality. We performed a survival analysis using log-rank test and Cox-regression with adjustment for age, sex and covariates based on premorbid health, disease severity, and the use of steroids for adult respiratory distress syndrome, including dexamethasone. Results Among 1893 included subjects, 21-day mortality was 23.4\% in 1552 subjects treated in hospitals that routinely prescribed (hydroxy)chloroquine, and 17.0\% in 341 subjects that were treated in hospitals that did not. In the adjusted Cox-regression models this difference disappeared, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.17 (95\%CI 0.88-1.55). When stratified by actually received treatment in individual subjects, the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine was associated with an increased 21-day mortality (HR 1.58; 95\%CI 1.25-2.01) in the full model. Conclusions After adjustment for confounders, mortality was not significantly different in hospitals that routinely treated patients with (hydroxy)chloroquine, compared with hospitals that did not. We compared outcomes of hospital strategies rather than outcomes of individual patients to reduce the chance of indication bias. This study adds evidence against the use of (hydroxy)chloroquine in patients with COVID-19. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Methods: It was a retrospective cohort study that incorporating the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in the Chongqing Public Health Medical Center. The prediction model was constructed with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression method and the model was further tested in the validation cohort. The performance was evaluated by the receiver operating curve (ROC), calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: A total of 217 patients were included in the study. During the treatment, 34 patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and no developed death. A model incorporating the demographic and clinical characteristics, imaging features and laboratory findings were constructed to predict the critical ill probability and it was proved to have good calibration, discrimination ability and clinic use.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background England, UK has experienced a large outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection. As in USA and elsewhere, disadvantaged communities have been disproportionately affected. Methods National REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) seroprevalence study using self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test for IgG among a random population sample of 100,000 adults over 18 years in England, 20 June to 13 July 2020. Results Completed questionnaires were available for 109,076 participants, yielding 5,544 IgG positive results and adjusted (for test performance), re-weighted (for sampling) prevalence of 6.0\% (95\% CI: 5.8, 6.1). Highest prevalence was in London (13.0\% [12.3, 13.6]), among people of Black or Asian (mainly South Asian) ethnicity (17.3\% [15.8, 19.1] and 11.9\% [11.0, 12.8] respectively) and those aged 18-24 years (7.9\% [7.3, 8.5]). Care home workers with client-facing roles had adjusted odds ratio of 3.1 (2.5, 3.8) compared with non-essential workers. One third (32.2\%, [31.0-33.4]) of antibody positive individuals reported no symptoms. Among symptomatic cases, the majority (78.8\%) reported symptoms during the peak of the epidemic in England in March (31.3\%) and April (47.5\%) 2020. We estimate that 3.36 million (3.21, 3.51) people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in England to end June 2020, with an overall infection fatality ratio of 0.90\% (0.86, 0.94). Conclusion The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection in England disproportionately affected ethnic minority groups and health and care home workers. The higher risk of infection in these groups may explain, at least in part, their increased risk of hospitalisation and mortality from COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The objective is to present our experience of tocilizumab use in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: Observational retrospective cohort study. Hospitalized patients were evaluated by our multidisciplinary team for eventual use of tocilizumab. Patients with progressive ventilatory impairment and evidence of a hyperinflammatory state despite usual treatment received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenous (maximum dose 800 mg), in addition to standard treatment. The use and time of use of mechanical ventilation (MV), the change of the Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient, of the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) and of inflammation laboratory parameters after 72 hours of tocilizumab use was evaluated. Results: 29 patients received tocilizumab. 93.1\% were men, 37.9\% were obese, and 34.5\% had hypertension. Of the 20 patients who were not on MV when receiving tocilizumab, 11 required non-invasive MV, for an average of five days, and one of them required intubation. A-a gradient, PaO2/FiO2, and inflammation parameters improved significantly. A better lymphocyte count, which improved significantly after tocilizumab use, was significantly associated with less use of MV. Five patients presented positive culture samples after tocilizumab, three being of clinical significance. A lower lymphocyte count was associated with having a positive culture. No other significant adverse events were seen. Conclusion: Our study suggests the utility and shows the safety of tocilizumab use in COVID-19 patients who have respiratory failure and evidence of hyperinflammation. Lymphocyte improvement was a predictor of good response.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Materials and Methods: A retrospective, observational cohort study of 112 inpatient adults diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 12 and April 16, 2020. Data were manually extracted from electronic medical records. Multivariable and Univariable regression were used to evaluate association between baseline characteristics, initial serum markers and the outcome of IMV. Results: Our cohort had median age of 61 (IQR 45-74) and was 66\% male. In-hospital mortality was 6\% (7/112). ICU mortality was 12.8\% (6/47), and 18\% (5/28) for those requiring IMV.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) mortality in hospitalised patients is strongly associated with old age, nursing home residence, male sex and obesity, with a more controversial association with ethnicity and chronic diseases, in particular diabetes mellitus. Further complicating the evaluation of the independent impacts of these risk factors is the failure to control for frailty in the published studies thus far. Aim: To determine the true risk factors for mortality in patients confirmed to have COVID-19 in Croydon needing hospital admission and to evaluate the independence of these risk factors in this group after adjusting for body mass index (BMI) and frailty. Methods: This observational study retrospectively reviewed hospital electronic medical records of 466 consecutive patients who were admitted to Croydon University Hospital confirmed positive by rapid PCR test from 11th March 2020 to 9th April 2020. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple unconditional and univariate logistic regression. Results: After multivariate analysis, male sex [OR 1.44 (CI 0.92-2.40)], age (per year) [OR 1.07 (CI 1.05-1.09)], morbid obesity (BMI \&gt; 40 kg/m2 vs reference BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 ) [OR 14.8 (CI 5.25-41.8)], and nursing home residence (OR 3.01 (CI 1.56-5.79) were independently associated with COVID-19 mortality with no statistically significant association found with chronic diseases or ethnicity. In the non-nursing home population, after adjusting for age and sex, the odds ratio for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as a risk factor was 1.64 (CI 1.03-2.61, p = 0.03) and was and was attenuated to 1.30 (CI 0.78-2.18)) after controlling for BMI; the association of mortality with male sex was strengthened [OR 1.66 (CI 0.96-2.87)] and that for ethnic minority patients was weakened [South Asians [from OR 1.30 (CI 0.67-2.53)) to OR 1.21 (CI 0.60-2.46)]; African Caribbeans [from OR 1.24 (CI 0.65-2.34) to OR 1.16 (CI 0.58-2.30)]. There was a borderline but potentially large protective effect (p= 0.09) in patients who were on anticoagulation drugs prior to admission [OR 0.56 (CI 0.28-1.11)]. Conclusion: Our study found no significant effect of ethnicity and chronic diseases as independent risk factors on COVID-19 mortality in Croydon population whereas male sex, high BMI, old age and frailty were found to be independent risk factors. Routine prophylactic treatment with anticoagulant drugs in the high-risk COVID-19 population warrants further prompt investigation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Little is known about long-term recovery from severe COVID-19 disease. Here, we characterize overall health, physical health and mental health of patients one month after discharge for severe COVID-19. Methods: This was a prospective single health system observational cohort study of patients ≥18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease who required at least 6 liters of oxygen during admission, had intact baseline cognitive and functional status and were discharged alive. Participants were enrolled between 30 and 40 days after discharge. Outcomes were elicited through validated survey instruments: the PROMIS Dyspnea Characteristics and PROMIS Global Health-10. Results: A total of 161 patients (40.6\% of eligible) were enrolled; 152 (38.3\%) completed the survey. Median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR], 50-67); 57 (37\%) were female. Overall, 113/152 (74\%) participants reported shortness of breath within the prior week (median score 3 out of 10 [IQR 0-5]), vs. 47/152 (31\%) pre-COVID-19 infection (0, IQR 0-1), p\&lt;0.001. Participants also rated their physical health and mental health as worse in their post-COVID state (43.8, standard deviation 9.3; mental health 47.3, SD 9.3) compared to their pre-COVID state, (54.3, SD 9.3; 54.3, SD 7.8, respectively), both p \&lt;0.001. A total of 52/148 (35.1\%) patients without pre-COVID oxygen requirements needed home oxygen after hospital discharge; 20/148 (13.5\%) reported still using oxygen at time of survey. Conclusions: Patients with severe COVID-19 disease typically experience sequelae affecting their respiratory status, physical health and mental health for at least several weeks after hospital discharge.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Prisons in the United States have become a hotbed for spreading Covid-19 among incarcerated individuals. Covid-19 cases among prisoners are on the rise, with more than 46,000 confirmed cases to date. However, there is paucity of data addressing clinical outcomes and mortality in prisoners hospitalized with Covid-19. Methods: An observational study of all patients hospitalized with Covid-19 between March 10 and May 10, 2020 at two Henry Ford Health System hospitals in Michigan. Clinical outcomes were compared amongst hospitalized prisoners and non-prisoner patients. The primary outcomes were intubation rates, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox-regression models were used to investigate primary outcomes. Results: Of the 706 hospitalized Covid-19 patients (mean age 66.7 +/- 16.1 years, 57\% males, and 44\% black), 108 were prisoners and 598 were non-prisoners. Compared to non-prisoners, prisoners were more likely to present with fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers. Prisoners were more commonly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (26.9\% vs. 18.7\%), required vasopressors (24.1\% vs. 9.9\%), and intubated (25.0\% vs. 15.2\%). Prisoners had higher unadjusted inpatient mortality (29.6\% vs. 20.1\%) and 30-day mortality (34.3\% vs. 24.6\%). In the adjusted models, prisoner status was associated with higher in-hospital death (odds ratio, 1.95; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.07 to 3.57) and 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95\% CI, 1.24 to 2.98). Conclusions: In this cohort of hospitalized Covid-19 patients, prisoner status was associated with more severe clinical presentation, higher rates of ICU admissions, vasopressors requirement, intubation, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, the drivers for this are not fully elucidated. We performed a retrospective cohort study, including detailed pre-hospital and presenting clinical and biochemical factors of 889 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in three constituent hospitals of a large London NHS Trust. 62\% of patients with severe COVID-19 were of non-White ethnic backgrounds and the prevalence of diabetes was 38\%. 323 (36\%) patients met the primary outcome of death or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) within 30 days of diagnosis. Male gender, advancing age and the Clinical Frailty Scale, an established measure of multimorbidity, independently predicted poor outcomes on multivariate analysis. Diabetes did not confer an independent risk for adverse outcomes in COVID-19, although patients with diabetes and ischaemic heart disease were at particular risk. Additional risk factors which significantly and independently associated with poorer outcomes in patients with diabetes were age, male gender and lower platelet count. Antiplatelet medication was associated with a lower risk of death/ICU admission and should be evaluated in randomised clinical trials amongst high risk patient groups.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND: Despite the significant morbidity and mortality caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), our understanding of basic disease epidemiology remains limited. This study aimed to describe key patient characteristics, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes of a large U.S.-based cohort of patients hospitalized with COVD-19 using electronic health records (EHR). METHODS: We identified patients in the Optum De-identified COVID-19 EHR database who had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 or a presumptive diagnosis between 20 February 2020 and 6 June 2020. We included hospitalizations that occurred 7 days prior to, or within 21 days after, COVID-19 diagnosis. Among hospitalized patients we describe the following: vital statistics and laboratory results on admission, relevant comorbidities (using diagnostic, procedural, and revenue codes), medications (NDC, HCPC codes), ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, length of stay (LOS), and mortality. RESULTS: We identified 76,819 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 16,780 of whom met inclusion criteria for COVID-related hospitalization. Over half the cohort was over age 50 (74.5\%), overweight or obese (77.2\%), or had hypertension (56.6\%). At admission, 30.3\% of patients presented with fever (\&gt;38C) and 32.3\% had low oxygen saturation (\&lt;90\%). Among the 16,099 patients with complete hospital records, we observed that 58.9\% had hypoxia, 23.4\% had an ICU stay during hospitalization, 18.1\% were ventilated, and 16.2\% died. The median LOS was 6 days (IQR: 4, 11). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest descriptive study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States. We report summary statistics of key clinical outcomes that provide insights to better understand COVID-19 disease epidemiology.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Fluoride ions are highly reactive, and their incorporation in forming dental enamel at low concentrations promotes mineralization. In contrast, excessive fluoride intake causes dental fluorosis, visually recognizable enamel defects that can increase the risk of caries. To investigate the molecular bases of dental fluorosis, we analyzed the effects of fluoride exposure in enamel cells to assess its impact on Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ signaling. Primary enamel cells and an enamel cell line (LS8) exposed to fluoride showed decreased internal Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ stores and store-operated Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ entry (SOCE). RNA-sequencing analysis revealed changes in gene expression suggestive of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in fluoride-treated LS8 cells. Fluoride exposure did not alter Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ homeostasis or increase the expression of ER stress–associated genes in HEK-293 cells. In enamel cells, fluoride exposure affected the functioning of the ER-localized Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ channel IP$_{\textrm{3}}$R and the activity of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$-ATPase (SERCA) pump during Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ refilling of the ER. Fluoride negatively affected mitochondrial respiration, elicited mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and disrupted mitochondrial morphology. Together, these data provide a potential mechanism underlying dental fluorosis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We report highly efficient mass transfer across physically perforated double-layer graphene, having up to a few million pores with narrowly distributed diameters between less than 10 nanometers and 1 micrometer. The measured transport rates are in agreement with predictions of 2D transport theories.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Insufficient evidence of factors predicting the COVID-19 progression from mild to moderate to critical has been established. We retrospectively evaluated risk factors for critical progression in Japanese COVID-19 patients. Method: Seventy-four laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in our hospital between February 20, 2020, and June 10, 2020. We excluded asymptomatic, non-Japanese, and child patients. We divided patients into the stable group (SG) and the progression group (PG) (patients requiring mechanical ventilation). We compared the clinical factors in both groups. We established the cutoff values (COVs) for significantly different factors via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and evaluated risk factors by univariate regression. Results: We enrolled 57 COVID-19 patients (median age 52 years, 56.1\% male). The median progression time from symptom onset was eight days. Seven patients developed critical disease (PG: 12.2\%), two (3.5\%) of whom died; 50 had stable disease. Univariate logistic analysis identified elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (COV: 309 U/l), decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (COV: 68 ml/min), lymphocytopenia (COV: 980/μl), and statin use as significantly associated with disease progression. However, in Cox proportional hazards analysis, lymphocytopenia at symptom onset was not significant. Conclusions: We identified three candidate risk factors for adult Japanese patients with mild to moderate COVID-19: statin use, elevated LDH level, and decreased eGFR.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we have recruited a 144 COVID-19 patient cohort consisting of training, validation, and internal test sets, longitudinally recorded 124 routine clinical and laboratory parameters, and built a machine learning model to predict the disease progression based on measurements from the first 12 days since the disease onset when no patient became severe. A panel of 11 routine clinical factors, including oxygenation index, basophil counts, aspartate aminotransferase, gender, magnesium, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, platelet counts, activated partial thromboplastin time, oxygen saturation, body temperature and days after symptom onset, constructed a classifier for COVID-19 severity prediction, achieving accuracy of over 94\%. Validation of the model in an independent cohort containing 25 patients achieved accuracy of 80\%. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 0.70, 0.99, 0.93 and 0.93, respectively. Our model captured predictive dynamics of LDH and CK while their levels were in the normal range.

Here, we explored mechanisms involving the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a potential basis for resistance to targeting KRAS*. Using the inducible \textit{Kras}$^{\textrm{G12D}}$;\textit{Trp53}$^{\textrm{−/−}}$ PDAC mouse model, gain-of-function screens of epigenetic regulators identified \textit{HDAC5} as the top hit enabling KRAS* independent tumor growth. \textit{HDAC5}-driven escaper tumors showed a prominent neutrophil-to-macrophage switch relative to KRAS*-driven tumors. Mechanistically, HDAC5 represses \textit{Socs3}, a negative regulator of chemokine CCL2, resulting in increased CCL2, which recruits CCR2$^{\textrm{+}}$ macrophages. Correspondingly, enforced \textit{Ccl2} promotes macrophage recruitment into the TME and enables tumor recurrence following KRAS* extinction. These tumor-associated macrophages in turn provide cancer cells with trophic support including TGFβ to enable KRAS* bypass in a SMAD4-dependent manner. Our work uncovers a KRAS* resistance mechanism involving immune cell remodeling of the PDAC TME.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Significance:{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Although KRAS* is required for PDAC tumor maintenance, tumors can recur following KRAS* extinction.

Confirmed cases are treated with clinical management as they are diagnosed but so far, there is no effective treatment or vaccine yet for Covid-19. Ayurveda has been recommended by preventative and clinical management guidelines in India and several clinical trials are ongoing. But there is no study to assess impact of Ayurveda on Covid-19. Methods Objective of present study was to evaluate the clinical outcome in Covid-19 confirmed asymptomatic to mild symptomatic patients who had received Ayurveda and compare with control (who has not received Ayurveda or any support therapy). Patients having Ayurveda intervention (Guduchi Ghan Vati-extract of Tinospora cordifolia) were included from Jodhpur Covid Care Centre and non-recipients were taken from Jaipur Covid Care Centre between May 15 to June 15, 2020. Total 91 patients, who were asymptomatic at the time of hospital admission and between 18 -75 years of age, were included in the study to analyse retrospectively. Results In control group, 11.7\% developed mild symptoms after average 1.8 days and none in Ayurveda group reported any symptoms. Significant difference was reported between the group of patients taking Guduchi Ghan Vati (n=40) and patients in standard care (n=51) in terms of virologic clearance at day-7 (97.5\% vs 15.6\% respectively; p=0.000), at day 14 (100\% vs 82.3\%) days to stay in hospital ( 6.4 vs 12.8 respectively; p\&lt; 0.0001) . Conclusion Results of the study suggest that Guduchi Ghan Vati, a common and widely used Ayurveda preparation, could benefit treating asymptomatic Covid-19 patients. Larger, randomised controlled Trials are required to confirm the findings. Keywords: Ayurveda, Guduchi Ghan{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION:
Elevated liver enzyme levels are observed in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, these features have not been characterized.

METHODS:
Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Zhejiang Province, China, from January 17 to February 12, 2020, were enrolled. Liver enzyme level elevation was defined as alanine aminotransferase level {\textgreater}35 U/L for men and 25 U/L for women at admission. Patients with normal alanine aminotransferase levels were included in the control group. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and patients symptomatic with SARS-CoV-2 infection were defined as patients with COVID-19. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected and compared.

RESULTS:
Of 788 patients with COVID-19, 222 (28.2\%) patients had elevated liver enzyme levels (median [interquartile range \{IQR\}] age, 47.0 [35.0–55.0] years; 40.5\% women). Being male, overweight, and smoking increased the risk of liver enzyme level elevation. The liver enzyme level elevation group had lesser pharyngalgia and more diarrhea than the control group. The median time from illness onset to admission was 3 days for liver enzyme level elevation groups (IQR, 2–6), whereas the median hospitalization time for 86 (38.7\%) discharged patients was 13 days (IQR, 11–16). No differences in disease severity and clinical outcomes were noted between the groups.

DISCUSSION:
We found that 28.2\% of patients with COVID-19 presented with elevated liver enzyme levels on admission, which could partially be related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male patients had a higher risk of liver enzyme level elevation. With early medical intervention, liver enzyme level elevation did not worsen the outcomes of patients with COVID-19.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Emerging data suggest variability in susceptibility and outcome to Covid-19 infection. Identifying the risk-factors associated with infection and outcomes in cancer patients is necessary to develop healthcare recommendations. Methods: We analyzed electronic health records of the US National Veterans Administration healthcare system and assessed the prevalence of Covid-19 infection in cancer patients. We evaluated the proportion of cancer patients tested for Covid-19 and their confirmed positivity, with clinical characteristics, and outcome, and stratified by demographics, comorbidities, cancer treatment and cancer type. Results: Of 22914 cancer patients tested for Covid-19, 1794 (7.8\%) were positive. The prevalence of Covid-19 was similar across all ages. Higher prevalence was observed in African-American (AA) (15\%) compared to white (5.5\%; P\&lt;.001), in Hispanic vs non-Hispanic population and in patients with hematologic malignancy compared to those with solid tumors (10.9\% vs 7.7\%; P\&lt;.001). Conversely, prevalence was lower in current smoker patients, patients with other co-morbidities and having recently received cancer therapy (\&lt;6 months). The Covid-19 attributable mortality was 10.9\%. Highest mortality rates were observed in older patients, those with renal dysfunction, higher Charlson co-morbidity score and with certain cancer types. Recent (\&lt;6 months) or past treatment did not influence mortality. Importantly, AA patients had 3.5-fold higher Covid-19 attributable hospitalization, however had similar mortality rate as white patients. Conclusion: Pre-existence of cancer affects both susceptibility to Covid-19 infection and eventual outcome. The overall Covid-19 attributable mortality in cancer patients is affected by age, co-morbidity and specific cancer types, however, race or recent treatment including immunotherapy does not impact outcome.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, there is limited information on management and outcomes of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and concomitant COVID19 infection. Objectives: This multisource national analysis of live data from England was designed to characterise the presenting profile and outcomes of patients hospitalized with ACS and COVID-19 infection. Methods: Multisource data from all acute NHS hospital in England was linked to study the characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 ACS compared to non COVID-19 ACS patients. Hierarchical multilevel models were constructed to study the association between COVID19 ACS and in-hospital and 30-day mortality. Results: Between 1st March 2020 and 31st May 2020, 517 (4.0\%) were admitted with COVID- 19 ACS from a total of 12,958 ACS patients. COVID-19 ACS patients were generally older, BAME ethnicity, more comorbid and had unfavourable presenting characteristics compared to non-COVID-19 ACS patients. They were less likely to receive invasive coronary strategy in the form of coronary angiography (67.7\% vs 81.0\%), PCI (30.2\% vs 53.9\%), dual antiplatelet medication 76.3\% vs 88.0\%), and other important secondary medication. Patients with COVID-19 ACS had higher in-hospital (aOR 3.27 95\%CI 2.41-4.42) and 30-day mortality (aOR 6.53 95\%CI 5.1-8.36) compared to non COVID-19 ACS group.

	abstract = {Background  There is uncertainty about the associations of angiotensive enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) drugs with COVID-19 disease. We studied whether patients prescribed these drugs had altered risks of contracting severe COVID-19 disease and receiving associated intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Methods  This was a prospective cohort study using routinely collected data from 1205 general practices in England with 8.28 million participants aged 20–99 years. We used Cox proportional hazards models to derive adjusted HRs for exposure to ACE inhibitor and ARB drugs adjusted for sociodemographic factors, concurrent medications and geographical region. The primary outcomes were: (a) COVID-19 RT-­PCR diagnosed disease and (b) COVID-19 disease resulting in ICU care. Findings  Of 19 486 patients who had COVID-19 disease, 1286 received ICU care. ACE inhibitors were associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 disease (adjusted HR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.67 to 0.74) but no increased risk of ICU care (adjusted HR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.75 to 1.06) after adjusting for a wide range of confounders. Adjusted HRs for ARBs were 0.63 (95\% CI 0.59 to 0.67) for COVID-19 disease and 1.02 (95\% CI 0.83 to 1.25) for ICU care. There were significant interactions between ethnicity and ACE inhibitors and ARBs for COVID-19 disease. The risk of COVID-19 disease associated with ACE inhibitors was higher in Caribbean (adjusted HR 1.05, 95\% CI 0.87 to 1.28) and Black African (adjusted HR 1.31, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.59) groups than the white group (adjusted HR 0.66, 95\% CI 0.63 to 0.70). A higher risk of COVID-19 with ARBs was seen for Black African (adjusted HR 1.24, 95\% CI 0.99 to 1.58) than the white (adjusted HR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.52 to 0.62) group. Interpretation  ACE inhibitors and ARBs are associated with reduced risks of COVID-19 disease after adjusting for a wide range of variables. Neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs are associated with significantly increased risks of receiving ICU care. Variations between different ethnic groups raise the possibility of ethnic-­specific effects of ACE inhibitors/ARBs on COVID-19 disease susceptibility and severity which deserves further study.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Disparate racial and ethnic burdens of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may be attributable to higher susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or to factors such as differences in hospitalization and care provision. In our cross-sectional analysis of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases from a tertiary, eight-hospital healthcare system (Houston Methodist) across greater Houston, multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate the odds of hospitalization and mortality for non-Hispanic Blacks (NHBs) vs. non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs) and Hispanics vs. non-Hispanics. Between March 3rd and July 18th, 2020, 70,496 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 12,084 (17.1\%) tested positive, of whom 3,536 (29.3\%) were hospitalized. Among positive cases, NHBs and Hispanics were significantly younger than NHWs and Hispanics, respectively (mean age NHBs vs. NHWs: 46.0 vs. 51.7 year and Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic: 44.0 vs. 48.7 years). Despite younger age, NHBs (vs. NHWs) had a higher prevalence of diabetes (25.2\%), hypertension (47.7\%), and chronic kidney disease (5.0\%). Both minority groups resided in lower median income and higher population density areas. In fully adjusted models, NHBs and Hispanics had higher likelihoods of hospitalization, aOR (CI): 1.42 (1.24-1.63) and 1.61 (1.46-1.78), respectively. No differences were observed in intensive care unit (ICU) utilization or treatment parameters. Models adjusted for demographics, vital signs, laboratory parameters, hospital complications, and ICU admission demonstrated non-significantly lower likelihoods of in-hospital mortality among NHBs and Hispanics, aOR (CI): 0.65 (0.40-1.03) and 0.89 (0.59-1.31), respectively. Our data did not demonstrate racial and ethnic differences in care provision and hospital outcomes. Higher susceptibility of racial and ethnic minorities to SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent hospitalization may be driven primarily by social determinants.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Research on IgG seroprevalence among health care workers (HCWs) is needed to re-evaluate health policies. This study was performed in three pandemic hospitals in Istanbul and Kocaeli. Different clusters of HCWs were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seropositivity rate among participants was evaluated by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. We recruited 813 non-infected and 119 PCR-confirmed infected HCWs. Of the previously undiagnosed HCWs, 22 (2.7\%) were seropositive. Seropositivity rates were highest for cleaning staff (6\%), physicians (4\%), nurses (2.2\%) and radiology technicians (1\%). Non-pandemic clinic (6.4\%) and ICU (4.3\%) had the highest prevalence. HCWs in high risk group had similar seropositivity rate with no risk group (2.9 vs 3.6 p=0.7), indicating the efficient implementation of protection measures in the hospitals in Turkey. These findings might lead to the re-evaluation of infection control and transmission dynamics in hospitals.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This study aimed to develop risk scores based on clinical characteristics at presentation to predict intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in COVID-19 patients. 641 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were selected from 4997 persons under investigation. We performed a retrospective review of medical records of demographics, comorbidities and laboratory tests at the initial presentation. Primary outcomes were ICU admission and death. Logistic regression was used to identify independent clinical variables predicting the two outcomes. The model was validated by splitting the data into 70\% for training and 30\% for testing. Performance accuracy was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC). Five significant variables predicting ICU admission were lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, pulse oxygen saturation, smoking history, and lymphocyte count. Seven significant variables predicting mortality were heart failure, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulse oxygen saturation, heart rate, and age. The mortality group uniquely contained cardiopulmonary variables. The risk score model yielded good accuracy with an AUC of 0.74 ([95\% CI, 0.63–0.85], p = 0.001) for predicting ICU admission and 0.83 ([95\% CI, 0.73–0.92], p{\textless}0.001) for predicting mortality for the testing dataset. This study identified key independent clinical variables that predicted ICU admission and mortality associated with COVID-19. This risk score system may prove useful for frontline physicians in clinical decision-making under time-sensitive and resource-constrained environment.},

	abstract = {Objectives To recognise clinical features of COVID-19 pneumonia and its differences from influenza pneumonia. Methods 246 patients were enrolled into COVID-19 cohort and 120 patients into influenza cohort. All data were collected and analysed retrospectively. The variables under focus included demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia and comparison were made with influenza pneumonia. Results The COVID-19 cohort included 53.25\% female and 46.75\% male. Their main symptom was fever; while 28.05\% of patients had only initially fever; 21.54\% of them remained feverless. After excluding prior kidney diseases, some patients showed abnormal urinalysis (32.11\%), elevated blood creatinine (15.04\%) and blood urea nitrogen (19.11\%). Typical CT features included ground glass opacity, consolidation and band opacity, which could present as characteristic ‘bat wing sign’. Our data showed that male, aged 65 or above, smoking, with comorbidities including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney diseases, would experience more severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In comparison, COVID-19 cohort showed significantly higher incidence of clustering; the influenza cohort showed higher rate of fever. Both cohorts showed reduced lymphocyte numbers; however, 6 influenza patients showed lymphocytes increased, which was statistical significant compared with COVID-19 cohort. Also, influenza cohort displayed higher white blood cell counts and PCT values. Conclusion There is no significant gender difference in the incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia. It predominantly affects the lung as well as the kidney. Age, smoking and comorbidities could contribute to disease severity. Although COVID-19 is more infectious, the rate of secondary bacterial infection is lower than influenza.},

Methods：In this retrospective, descriptive, multiple-center study, total of 267 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time RT-PCR in Chongqing from Jan 19 to Feb 16, 2020 were recruited. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological characteristics, laboratory examinations, and treatment regimens were collected on admission. Clinical outcomes were followed up until Feb 16, 2020. Results：267 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 3 designated-hospitals in Chongqing provincial municipality from January 19 to February 16, 2020 were enrolled and categorized on admission. 217 (81.27\%) and 50 (18.73\%) patients were categorized into non-severe and severe subgroups, respectively. The median age of patients was 48.0 years (IQR, 35.0-65.0), with 129 (48.3\%) of the patients were more than 50 years of age. 149 (55.8\%) patients were men. Severe patients were significantly older (median age, 71.5 years [IQR, 65.8-77.0] vs 43.0 years [IQR, 32.5-57.0]) and more likely to be male (110 [50.7\%] vs 39 [78.0\%]) and have coexisting disorders (15 [30.0\%] vs 26 [12.0\%]). 41 (15.4\%) patients had a recent travel to Hubei province, and 139 (52.1\%) patients had a history of contact with patients from Hubei. On admission, the most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever 225(84.3\%), fatigue (208 [77.9\%]), dry cough (189 [70.8\%]), myalgia or arthralgia (136 [50.9\%]). Severe patients were more likely to present dyspnea (17 [34.0\%] vs 26 [12.0\%]) and confusion (10 [20.0\%] vs 15 [6.9\%]). Rales (32 [12.0\%]) and wheezes (20 [7.5\%]) are not common noted for COVID-19 patients, especially for the non-severe (11 [5.1\%], 10 [4.6\%]). 118 (44.2\%). Most severe patients demonstrated more laboratory abnormalities. 231 (86.5\%), 61 (22.8\%) patients had lymphopenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. CD4+T cell counts decrease was observed in 77.1 \% of cases, especially in the severe patients (45, 100\%). 53.1\% patients had decreased CD+3 T cell counts, count of CD8+T cells was lower than the normal range in part of patients (34.4\%). More severe patients had lower level of CD4+ T cells and CD+3 T cells (45 [100.0\%] vs 29[56.9\%], 31 [68.9\%] vs 20 [39.2\%]). Most patients had normal level of IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α and INF-γ, while high level of IL-6 and IL-17A was common in COVID-19 patients (47 [70.1\%], 35 [52.2\%]). Level of IL-6, IL-17A and TNF-α was remarkably elevated in severe patients (32 [84.2\%] vs 15 [51.7\%], 25 [65.8\%] vs 10 [34.5\%], 17 [44.7\%] vs 5 [17.2\%]). All patients received antiviral therapy (267, 100\%). A portion of severe patients (38, 76.0\%) received systemic corticosteroid therapy. Invasive mechanical ventilation in prone position, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy was adopted only in severe patients with respiratory failure (5[10.0\%], 35[70.0\%], 12[24.0\%]). Traditional Chinese medicine was adopted to most of severe patients (43,86.0\%). Conclusion:Our study firstly demonstrated the regional disparity of COVID-19 in Chongqing municipality and further thoroughly compared the differences between severe and non-severe patients. The 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients from 3 designed hospitals of Chongqing is 1.5\%, lower than that of Hubei province and mainland China including Hubei province. However, the 28-mortality of severe patients was relatively high, with much higher when complications occurred. Notably, the 28-mortality of critically severe patients complicated with severe ARDS is considerably as high as 44.4\%. Therefore, early diagnosis and intensive care of critically severe COVID-19 cases, especially those combined with ARDS, will be considerably essential to reduce mortality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Outcomes in pregnancies complicated by preexisting diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and gestational diabetes mellitus have improved, but there is still excess morbidity compared with normal pregnancy. Management strategies appropriately focus on maternal glycemia, which demonstrably improves pregnancy outcomes for mother and infant. However, we may be reaching the boundaries of obtainable glycemic control for many women. It has been acknowledged that maternal lipids are important in pregnancies complicated by diabetes. Elevated maternal lipids are associated with preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and large-for-gestational-age infants. Despite this understanding, assessment of management strategies targeting maternal lipids has been neglected to date. Consideration needs to be given to whether normalizing maternal lipids would further improve pregnancy outcomes. This review examines the dyslipidemia associated with pregnancy complicated by diabetes, reviews possible therapies, and considers whether it is time to start actively managing this aspect of maternal metabolism.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Haloperidol, a widely used antipsychotic, has been suggested as potential effective treatment for Covid-19 on the grounds of its in-vitro antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: We examined the association between haloperidol use and respiratory failure at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Data were obtained regarding all adult patients hospitalized with Covid-19 since the beginning of the epidemic. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death and the secondary endpoint was discharge home among survivors in time-to-event analyses. We compared outcomes between patients who were exposed to haloperidol and those who were not, using a multivariable Cox regression model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. Results: Of the 13,279 hospitalized adult patients with positive Covid-19 RT-PCR test, 667 patients (5.0\%) were excluded because of missing data. Of the remaining 12,612 patients, 104 (0.8\%) were exposed to haloperidol. Over a mean follow-up of 20.8 days, the primary endpoint of respiratory failure respectively occurred in 27 patients (26.0\%) exposed to haloperidol and 1,700 patients (13.6\%) who were not. Among survivors, the secondary endpoint of discharge home occurred in 26 patients (32.1\%) who received haloperidol and 6,110 patients (55.3\%) who did not. In the main analysis, there were no significant associations between haloperidol use and the primary (HR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 1.97, p=0.772) and secondary (HR, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.50 to 1.53, p=0.643) endpoints. Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, haloperidol use was not associated with risk of intubation or death, or with time to hospital discharge home. These results suggest that haloperidol is unlikely to have a clinical efficacy for Covid-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Intrinsically generated patterns of coupled neuronal activity are associated with the dynamics of specific brain states. Sensory inputs are extrinsic factors that can perturb these intrinsic coupling modes, creating a complex scenario in which forthcoming stimuli are processed. Studying this intrinsic-extrinsic interplay is necessary to better understand perceptual integration and selection. Here, we show that this interplay leads to a reconfiguration of functional cortical connectivity that acts as a mechanism to facilitate stimulus processing. Using audiovisual stimulation in anesthetized ferrets, we found that this reconfiguration of coupling modes is context specific, depending on long-term modulation by repetitive sensory inputs. These reconfigured coupling modes lead to changes in latencies and power of local field potential responses that support multisensory integration. Our study demonstrates that this interplay extends across multiple time scales and involves different types of intrinsic coupling. These results suggest a previously unknown large-scale mechanism that facilitates multisensory integration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

IELTS scores correlated significantly with later performance, multiple regression showing that the effect of PLAB1 (β=0.496) was much stronger than the effect of IELTS (β=0.086). Changes to PLAB pass marks that would result in international medical graduate and UK medical graduate equivalence were assessed in two ways. Method 1 adjusted PLAB pass marks to equate median performance of PLAB and UK graduates. Method 2 divided PLAB graduates into 12 equally spaced groups according to PLAB performance, and compared these with mean performance of graduates from individual UK medical schools, assessing which PLAB groups were equivalent in MRCP(UK) and MRCGP performance to UK graduates. The two methods produced similar results. To produce equivalent performance on the MRCP and MRGP examinations, the pass mark for PLAB1 would require raising by about 27 marks (13\%) and for PLAB2 by about 15-16 marks (20\%) above the present standard.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}\textbf{Conclusions} PLAB is a valid assessment of medical knowledge and clinical skills, correlating well with performance at MRCP(UK) and MRCGP. PLAB graduates’ knowledge and skills at MRCP(UK) and MRCGP are over one standard deviation below those of UK graduates, although differences in training quality cannot be taken into account. Equivalent performance in MRCGP(UK) and MRCGP would occur if the pass marks of PLAB1 and PLAB2 were raised considerably, but that would also reduce the pass rate, with implications for medical workforce planning. Increasing IELTS requirements would have less impact on equivalence than raising PLAB pass marks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background African-Americans/Blacks have suffered higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 than all other racial groups. This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions. Method We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a five-week period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population Result Of the 1,070 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 496 critically ill patients were hospitalized and included in the study. 88\% of patients were Black; and a majority (53\%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the 9obese9 range. 97\% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (84\%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (57\%) and chronic kidney disease (24\%). Patients with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease who received hemodialysis were found to have significantly lower mortality, then those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis (11\%, OR, 0.35, CI, 0.17 - 0.69 P=0.001). Age \&gt;60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox Proportional Hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg/L), LDH (551, 638 U/L), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL), and neutrophil / lymphocyte ratio (8.5, 10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48-96 hrs. Of the 496 inpatients, 48\% died, one third of patients died within the first three days of admission. 54/488 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 87\% died and of the remaining patients, 32\% died. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients in our predominantly Black neighborhood had higher mortality, likely due to higher prevalence of comorbidities. Early dialysis and pre-admission intake of ACE inhibitors/ARBs improved patient outcomes. Early escalation of care based on comorbidities and key laboratory indicators is critical for improving outcomes in African-American patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Introduction The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe, overwhelming healthcare systems and depleting resources. The infection has a wide spectrum of presentations, and pre-existing comorbidities have been found to have a dramatic effect on the disease course and prognosis. We sought to analyze the effect of asthma on the disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Methods We conducted a multi-center retrospective study of positively confirmed COVID-19 patients from multiple hospitals in Louisiana. Demographics, medical history, comorbidities, clinical presentation, daily laboratory values, complications, and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, risk of intubation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. Results A total of 502 COVID-19 patients (72 asthma and 430 non-asthma cohorts) were included in the study. The frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3\%, higher than the national prevalence of asthma (7.7\%). Univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese (75\% vs 54.2\%, p=0.001), with higher frequency of intubation (40.3\% vs 27.8\%, p = 0.036), and required longer duration of hospitalization (15.1±12.5 vs 11.5±10.6, p=0.015). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that asthmatic patients were not associated with higher risk of ICU admission (OR=1.81, 95\%CI=0.98-3.09, p=0.06), endotracheal intubation (OR=1.77, 95\%CI=0.99-3.04, p=0.06) or complications (OR=1.37, 95\%CI=0.82-2.31, p=0.23). Asthmatic patients were not associated with higher odds of prolonged hospital length of stay (OR=1.48, 95\%CI=0.82-2.66, p=0.20) or with the duration of ICU stay (OR=0.76, 95\%CI=0.28-2.02, p=0.58). Kaplan-Meier curve showed no significant difference in overall survival of the two groups (p=0.65). Conclusion Despite the increased prevalence of hospitalization in asthmatic COVID-19 patients compared to the general population, after adjustment for other variables, it was neither associated with increased severity nor worse outcomes.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel human coronavirus, there is no specific antiviral drugs. It has been proved that host-cell-expressed CD147 could bind spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and involve in host cell invasion. Antibody against CD147 could block the infection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, as add-on therapy in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: All patients received recommended strategy from Diagnosis and Treatment for 2019 Novel Coronavirus Diseases released by National Health Commission of China. Eligible patients were add-on administered 10 mg meplazumab intravenously at days 1, 2, and 5. Patients hospitalized in the same period were observed as concurrent control. The endpoints include virological clearance rate, case severity, chest radiographic, and laboratory test. This trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of Institution at the Tangdu hospital, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT 04275245. Findings:17 patients were enrolled and assigned to meplazumab group between Feb 3, 2020 and Feb 10, 2020. 11 hospitalized patients served as concurrent control. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across two groups. Compared to control group, meplazumab treatment significantly improved the discharged (p=0.006) and case severity (p=0.021) in critical and severe patients. The time to virus negative in meplazumab group was reduced than that in control group (median 3, 95\%CI[1.5-4.5] vs. 13, [6.5-19.5]; p=0.014, HR=0.37, 95\%CI[0.155-0.833]). The percentages of patients recovered to the normal lymphocyte count and CRP concentration were also increased remarkably and rapidly in meplazumab group. No adverse effect was found in meplazumab-treated patients. Interpretation:Meplazumab efficiently improved the recovery of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with a favorable safety profile. Our results support to carry out a large-scale investigation of meplazumab as a treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia. Funding:National Science and Technology Major Project.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Introduction: Hospital mortality due to COVID-19 in Mexico is high (32\%) and as of today, effective treatment options are limited. More effective treatments that shorten hospital stay and reduce mortality are needed. Initial reports for the use of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy for COVID-19 appear promising. We describe a case series of eight patients with impending respiratory failure, who underwent CP therapy. Methods: Six male and two female (ages 31 to 79) patients that were admitted to the intensive-care unit for severe COVID-19 were transfused with two doses of CP (250 mL per dose, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers {\textgreater} 1:100). Donors were six SARS-CoV-2 infected males who remained asymptomatic for {\textgreater} 7 days and were negative for two nasopharyngeal RT-PCR tests. Clinical characteristics, inflammatory and cellular injury markers, chest X-ray findings and viral loads were analyzed before and after CP administration. Viral load association to disease severity was further analyzed on a separate cohort of asymptomatic vs hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Results: Eight patients with respiratory failure were successfully discharged with a median length of stay of 22.5 (IQR 18.25-29.00). After CP therapy, we observed a reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) (median, 22.80 mg/dL vs. 1.63 mg/dL), and of procalcitonin (median, 0.27 ng/mL vs. 0.13 ng/mL). High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I (hs-cTnI), Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) were lower, and a mild reduction of pulmonary infiltrates by chest X-ray was observed. Lastly, a reduction of viral load was after CP therapy was found. (log, median [IQR], 1.2 [0.70-2.20] vs. 0.25 [0.00-1.78]). We observed no adverse effects. Conclusions: CP could potentially be an effective therapeutic option for patients with severe COVID-19. Clinical benefit needs to be studied further through randomized controlled trials.

Demographic and clinical data of COVID-19 patients until June 11th, 2020 were retrieved from the State Health Secretariat of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Potential risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and death were analyzed by univariate and multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 10,713 COVID-19 patients were included in this study; 81.0\% were younger than 60 years, 55.2\% were female, 89.2\% were not hospitalized, 32.9\% had at least one comorbidity, and 7.7\% died. The most common symptoms on admission were cough (67.7\%) and fever (62.6\%); 7.1\% of the patients were asymptomatic. Cardiovascular diseases (23.7\%) and diabetes (10.3\%) were the two most common chronic diseases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified an association of all explanatory variables, except for cough and diarrhea, with hospitalization. Older age (odds ratio [OR] = 3.95, P \&lt; 0.001) and shortness of breath (OR = 3.55, P \&lt; 0.001) were associated with increase of odds to COVID-19 death in hospitalized patients. Our study provided evidence that older age, male gender, Asian, indigenous or unknown race, comorbidities (smoking, kidney disease, obesity, pulmonary disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease), as well as fever and shortness of breath increased the risk of hospitalization. For death outcome in hospitalized patients, only older age and shortness of breath increased the risk.},

	abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the association of olfactory dysfunction (OD) with hospitalization for COVID-19. Study Design: Multi-center cohort study. Setting: Emergency departments of thirteen COVID-19-designed hospitals in Kurdistan province, Iran. Subjects and Methods: Patients presenting with flu-like symptoms who tested positive by RT-PCR for COVID-19 between May 1st and 31st, 2020. At the time of presentation and enrollment, patients were asked about the presence of OD, fever, cough, shortness of breath, headache, rhinorrhea and sore throat. The severity of OD was assessed on an 11-point scale from 0 (none) to 10 (anosmia). Patients were either hospitalized or sent home for outpatient care based on standardized criteria. Results: Of 203 patients, who presented at a mean of 6 days into the COVID-19 disease course, 25 patients (12.3\%) had new OD and 138 patients (68.0\%) were admitted for their COVID-19. Patients admitted for COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of all symptoms assessed, including OD (p{\textless}0.05 in all cases), and OD identified admitted patients with 84.0\% sensitivity and 34.3\% specificity. On univariate logistic regression, hospitalization was associated with OD (odds ratio [OR] = 2.47, 95\%CI: 1.085-6.911, p=0.049). However, hospitalization for COVID-19 was not associated with OD (OR=3.22, 95\% CI: 0.57-18.31, p=0.188) after controlling for confounding demographics and comorbidities. Conclusion: OD may be associated with hospitalization for (and therefore more severe) COVID-19. However, this association between OD and COVID-19 severity is more likely driven by patient characteristics linked to OD, such as greater numbers of COVID-19 symptoms experienced or high-risk comorbidities.

	abstract = {Background Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly expanding global pandemic resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 patients may present with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The aim of this study is to conduct detailed analysis on patients with AMI and COVID-19. Methods We included all patients admitted with AMI and actively known or found to be COVID-19 positive by PCR between the 4th February 2020 and the 11th June 2020 in the State of Qatar. Patients were divided into ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and Non-STE (NSTEMI). Results There were 68 patients (67 men and 1 woman) admitted between the 4th of February 2020 and the 11th of June 2020 with AMI and COVID-19. The mean age was 49.1, 46 patients had STEMI and 22 had NSTEMI. 38\% had diabetes mellitus, 31\% had hypertension, 16\% were smokers, 13\% had dyslipidemia, and 14.7\% had prior cardiovascular disease. Chest pain and dyspnea were the presenting symptoms in 90\% and 12\% of patients respectively. Fever (15\%) and cough (15\%) were the most common COVID-19 symptoms, while the majority had no viral symptoms. Thirty-nine (33 STEMI and 6 NSTEMI) patients underwent coronary angiography, 38 of them had significant coronary disease. Overall in-hospital MACE was low; 1 patient developed stroke and 2 died. Conclusion Contrary to previous small reports, overall in-hospital adverse events were low in this largest cohort of COVID-19 patients presenting with AMI. We hypothesize patient profile including younger age contributed to these findings. Further studies are required to confirm this observation.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background Understanding risk factors for death in Covid 19 is key to providing good quality clinical care. Due to a paucity of robust evidence, we sought to assess the presenting characteristics of patients with Covid 19 and investigate factors associated with death. Methods Retrospective analysis of adults admitted with Covid 19 to Royal Oldham Hospital, UK. Logistic regression modelling was utilised to explore factors predicting death. Results 470 patients were admitted, of whom 169 (36\%) died. The median age was 71 years (IQR 57 to 82), and 255 (54.3\%) were men. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n=218, 46.4\%), diabetes (n=143, 30.4\%) and chronic neurological disease (n=123, 26.1\%). The most frequent complications were acute kidney injury (n=157, 33.4\%) and myocardial injury (n=21, 4.5\%). Forty three (9.1\%) patients required intubation and ventilation, and 39 (8.3\%) received non-invasive ventilation Independent risk factors for death were increasing age (OR per 10 year increase above 40 years 1.87, 95\% CI 1.57 to 2.27), hypertension (OR 1.72, 1.10 to 2.70), cancer (OR 2.20, 1.27 to 3.81), platelets \&lt;150x103/microlitre (OR 1.93, 1.13 to 3.30), C-reactive protein \&gt;100 micrograms/mL (OR 1.68, 1.05 to 2.68), \&gt;50\% chest radiograph infiltrates, (OR 2.09, 1.16 to 3.77) and acute kidney injury (OR 2.60, 1.64 to 4.13). There was no independent association between death and gender, ethnicity, deprivation level, fever, SpO2/FiO2 (oxygen saturation index), lymphopenia or other comorbidities. Conclusions We characterised the first wave of patients with Covid 19 in one of Englands highest incidence areas, determining which factors predict death. These findings will inform clinical and shared decision making, including the use of respiratory support and therapeutic agents.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Chronic kidney disease patients show a high mortality in case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, to be informed on Nephrology personnel9s sero-status might be crucial for patient protection. However, limited information exists about the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in asymptomatic individuals. Methods: We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies among health care workers of a tertiary care kidney center during the peak phase of the Covid-19 crisis in Austria using an orthogonal test strategy and a total of 12 commercial nucleocapsid protein or spike glycoprotein based assays as well as Western blotting and a neutralization assay. Results: At baseline 60 of 235 study participants (25.5\%, 95\% CI: 20.4-31.5) were judged to be borderline positive or positive for IgM or IgG using a high sensitivity/low specificity threshold in one test system. Follow-up analysis after about two weeks revealed IgG positivity in 12 (5.1\%, 95\% CI: 2.9-8.8) and IgM positivity in six (2.6\%, 95\% CI: 1.1-5.6) in at least one assay. 2.1\% (95\% CI: 0.8-5.0) of health care workers showed IgG nucleocapsid antibodies in at least two assays. By contrast, positive controls with proven Covid-19 showed antibody positivity among almost all test systems. Moreover, serum samples obtained from health care workers did not show SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing capacity, in contrast to positive controls. Conclusions: Using a broad spectrum of antibody tests the present study revealed inconsistent results for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among asymptomatic individuals, while this was not the case among Covid-19 patients.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The function of temporally regulated centromeric transcription, and transcripts, is consequently a topic of intense investigation. In this study, we use high throughput approaches to identify and describe lncRNAs associated with the centromere specific histone variant CENP-A that arise from the transcription of specific centromeres at early G1, which we then show are physically associated with centromeres, and which are functionally necessary for accurate chromosome segregation. Targeted depletion of one such centromeric RNA, which originates from a single centromere, is sufficient to increase the frequency of chromosome segregation defects. These data support the emerging paradigm of the necessity of centromere-specific lncRNAs in the integrity of faithful chromosome segregation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Allergic skin inflammation elicited by epicutaneous immunization of mice with ovalbumin (OVA), a potential model of atopic dermatitis, was severely impaired in TSLPR$^{\textrm{−/−}}$ mice, as evidenced by decreased infiltration of eosinophils and decreased local expression of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines. However, secretion of Th2 cytokines by splenocytes from epicutaneous sensitized TSLPR$^{\textrm{−/−}}$ mice in response to OVA was normal. Skin dendritic cells from TSLPR$^{\textrm{−/−}}$ mice were normal in their ability to migrate to draining lymph nodes, express activation markers, and induce proliferation and Th2 cytokine production by naïve T cells. CD4$^{\textrm{+}}$ T cells from TSLPR$^{\textrm{−/−}}$ mice expressed the skin homing receptor E-selectin ligand normally, and homed to the skin normally, but failed to transfer allergic skin inflammation to WT recipients. TSLP enhanced Th2 cytokine secretion \textit{in vitro} by targeting TSLPR on antigen specific T cells. Intradermal injection of anti-TSLP blocked the development of allergic skin inflammation after cutaneous antigen challenge of OVA immunized WT mice. These findings suggest that TSLP is essential for antigen driven Th2 cytokine secretion by skin infiltrating effector T cells and could be a therapeutic target in allergic skin inflammation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Current methods of measuring these parameters in \textit{Drosophila melanogaster} have low temporal resolution and/or require disrupting sleep. Here we report a novel analysis tool for high-resolution, non-invasive measurement of sleep pressure and depth from movement data. Probability of transitioning to an active state, P(Wake), measures sleep depth while probability of transitioning to an inactive state, P(Doze), measures sleep pressure. \textit{In vivo} and computational analyses show that P(Wake) and P(Doze) are independent and control the amount of total sleep. Importantly, we demonstrate that these probabilities are tied to specific biological processes. Genetic and environmental perturbations demonstrate that a given amount of sleep can be produced by many combinations of underlying P(Wake) and P(Doze). We show that measuring sleep pressure and depth continuously, without disturbing on-going behavior, provides greater mechanistic insight into behavior than measuring the amount of sleep alone.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background Many different treatments were heavily administered to patients with COVID-19 during the peak of the pandemic in Madrid without robust evidence supporting them. Methods We examined the association between sixteen treatments in four groups (steroids, antivirals, antibiotics and immunomodulators) and intubation or death. Data were obtained from patients that were admitted to an HM hospital with suspicion of COVID-19 until 24/04/2020, excluding unconfirmed diagnosis, those who were admitted before the epidemic started in Madrid, had an outcome that was not discharge or death or died within 24 hours of presentation. We compared outcomes between treated and untreated patients using propensity-score caliper matching. Results Of 2,307 patients in the dataset, 679 were excluded. Of the remaining 1,645 patients, 263 (16\%) died and 311 (18.9\%) died or were intubated. Except for hydroxychloroquine and prednisone, patients that were treated with any of the medications were more likely to go through an outcome of death or intubation at baseline. After propensity matching we found an association between treatment with hydroxychloroquine and prednisone and better outcomes (hazard ratios with 95\% CI of 0.83 +- 0.06 and 0.85 +- 0.03). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusions In this multicenter study of patients admitted with COVID-19 hydroxychloroquine and prednisone administration was found to be associated with improved outcomes. Other treatments were associated with no effect or worse outcomes. Randomized, controlled trials of these medications in patients with COVID-19 are needed to avoid heavy administration of treatments with no strong evidence to support them.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This review outlines the benefits of using multiple approaches to improve model design and facilitate multidisciplinary research into infectious diseases, as well as showing and proposing practical examples of effective integration. It looks particularly at the benefits of using participatory research in conjunction with traditional modelling methods to potentially improve disease research, control and management. Integrated approaches can lead to more realistic mathematical models which in turn can assist with making policy decisions that reduce disease and benefit local people. The emergence, risk, spread and control of diseases are affected by many complex bio-physical, environmental and socio-economic factors. These include climate and environmental change, land-use variation, changes in population and people’s behaviour. The evidence base for this scoping review comes from the work of a consortium, with the aim of integrating modelling approaches traditionally used in epidemiological, ecological and development research. A total of five examples of the impacts of participatory research on the choice of model structure are presented. Example 1 focused on using participatory research as a tool to structure a model. Example 2 looks at identifying the most relevant parameters of the system. Example 3 concentrates on identifying the most relevant regime of the system (e.g., temporal stability or otherwise), Example 4 examines the feedbacks from mathematical models to guide participatory research and Example 5 goes beyond the so-far described two-way interplay between participatory and mathematical approaches to look at the integration of multiple methods and frameworks. This scoping review describes examples of best practice in the use of participatory methods, illustrating their potential to overcome disciplinary hurdles and promote multidisciplinary collaboration, with the aim of making models and their predictions more useful for decision-making and policy formulation.},

	abstract = {Understanding of spatiotemporal transmission of infectious diseases has improved significantly in recent years. Advances in Bayesian inference methods for individual-level geo-located epidemiological data have enabled reconstruction of transmission trees and quantification of disease spread in space and time, while accounting for uncertainty in missing data. However, these methods have rarely been applied to endemic diseases or ones in which asymptomatic infection plays a role, for which novel estimation methods are required. Here, we develop such methods to analyse longitudinal incidence data on visceral leishmaniasis (VL), and its sequela, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), in a highly endemic community in Bangladesh. Incorporating recent data on infectiousness of VL and PKDL, we show that while VL cases drive transmission when incidence is high, the contribution of PKDL increases significantly as VL incidence declines (reaching 55\% in this setting). Transmission is highly focal: {\textgreater}85\% of mean distances from inferred infectors to their secondary VL cases were {\textless}300m, and estimated average times from infector onset to secondary case infection were {\textless}4 months for 90\% of VL infectors, but up to 2.75yrs for PKDL infectors. Estimated numbers of secondary VL cases per VL and PKDL case varied from 0-6 and were strongly correlated with the infector's duration of symptoms. Counterfactual simulations suggest that prevention of PKDL could have reduced VL incidence by up to a quarter. These results highlight the need for prompt detection and treatment of PKDL to achieve VL elimination in the Indian subcontinent and provide quantitative estimates to guide spatiotemporally-targeted interventions against VL.},

	abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases in humans are frequently caused by pathogens originating from animal hosts, and zoonotic disease outbreaks present a major challenge to global health. To investigate drivers of virus spillover, we evaluated the number of viruses mammalian species have shared with humans. We discovered that the number of zoonotic viruses detected in mammalian species scales positively with global species abundance, suggesting that virus transmission risk has been highest from animal species that have increased in abundance and even expanded their range by adapting to human-dominated landscapes. Domesticated species, primates and bats were identified as having more zoonotic viruses than other species. Among threatened wildlife species, those with population reductions owing to exploitation and loss of habitat shared more viruses with humans. Exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade facilitates close contact between wildlife and humans, and our findings provide further evidence that exploitation, as well as anthropogenic activities that have caused losses in wildlife habitat quality, have increased opportunities for animal–human interactions and facilitated zoonotic disease transmission. Our study provides new evidence for assessing spillover risk from mammalian species and highlights convergent processes whereby the causes of wildlife population declines have facilitated the transmission of animal viruses to humans.},

	abstract = {As anthropogenic climate change continues the risks to biodiversity will increase over time, with future projections indicating that a potentially catastrophic loss of global biodiversity is on the horizon1–3. However, our understanding of when and how abruptly this climate-driven disruption of biodiversity will occur is limited because biodiversity forecasts typically focus on individual snapshots of the future. Here we use annual projections (from 1850 to 2100) of temperature and precipitation across the ranges of more than 30,000 marine and terrestrial species to estimate the timing of their exposure to potentially dangerous climate conditions. We project that future disruption of ecological assemblages as a result of climate change will be abrupt, because within any given ecological assemblage the exposure of most species to climate conditions beyond their realized niche limits occurs almost simultaneously. Under a high-emissions scenario (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5), such abrupt exposure events begin before 2030 in tropical oceans and spread to tropical forests and higher latitudes by 2050. If global warming is kept below 2 °C, less than 2\% of assemblages globally are projected to undergo abrupt exposure events of more than 20\% of their constituent species; however, the risk accelerates with the magnitude of warming, threatening 15\% of assemblages at 4 °C, with similar levels of risk in protected and unprotected areas. These results highlight the impending risk of sudden and severe biodiversity losses from climate change and provide a framework for predicting both when and where these events may occur.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in modern coexistence theory (MCT) have advanced our understanding of how species interactions among themselves and with the environment influence community dynamics. Although the formulation of MCT is mathematically clear, its application to empirical cases is still challenging, which precludes its adoption by a large range of ecologists and evolutionary biologists interested in broad questions related to community assembly and the maintenance of species diversity. We developed cxr, an r package that provides a complete toolbox for calculating species vital rates and interaction parameters, from which the user can obtain estimates of coexistence outcomes based on stabilizing niche differences and average fitness differences. Our aim is to offer a highly versatile package to accommodate different research needs. This means that the user can define population models, use different optimization algorithms and include the effect of external covariates on species interactions, which may include environmental variables (e.g. temperature, precipitation, salinity) and biotic controls (e.g. predation, pollination, mycorrhizae). To illustrate the functionality and versatility of cxr, we provide a complete set of population dynamic models and a dataset from a highly diverse grassland community. By building bridges between MCT formulation and its implementation, we provide tools to obtain a deeper mechanistic understanding of how species interactions determine basic patterns such as species abundances and dominance, which are core information for many applied fields, such as conservation, restoration and invasion biology. Finally, the package is not limited taxonomically to any particular group. The application of tools derived from MCT to a wide range of different systems can create feedbacks between empirical and theoretical studies in a way that stimulates a better understanding of the processes maintaining biodiversity.},

Applying modern analytical tools such as machine learning to increasingly high dimensional data offers the potential to expand our perspectives on these processes, shedding new light on complex ecological phenomena such as pathogen transmission in wild populations. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines data mining with theoretical models of disease dynamics. Using rodents as an example, we incorporate statistical differences in the life history features of zoonotic reservoir hosts into pathogen transmission models, enabling us to bound the range of dynamical phenomena associated with hosts, based on their traits. We then test for associations between equilibrium prevalence, a key epidemiological metric and data on human outbreaks of rodent-borne zoonoses, identifying matches between empirical evidence and theoretical predictions of transmission dynamics. We show how this framework can be generalized to other systems through a rubric of disease models and parameters that can be derived from empirical data. By linking life history components directly to their effects on disease dynamics, our mining-modelling approach integrates machine learning and theoretical models to explore mechanisms in the macroecology of pathogen transmission and their consequences for spillover infection to humans.},

	abstract = {Land use change-for example, the conversion of natural habitats to agricultural or urban ecosystems-is widely recognized to influence the risk and emergence of zoonotic disease in humans1,2. However, whether such changes in risk are underpinned by predictable ecological changes remains unclear. It has been suggested that habitat disturbance might cause predictable changes in the local diversity and taxonomic composition of potential reservoir hosts, owing to systematic, trait-mediated differences in species resilience to human pressures3,4. Here we analyse 6,801 ecological assemblages and 376 host species worldwide, controlling for research effort, and show that land use has global and systematic effects on local zoonotic host communities. Known wildlife hosts of human-shared pathogens and parasites overall comprise a greater proportion of local species richness (18-72\% higher) and total abundance (21-144\% higher) in sites under substantial human use (secondary, agricultural and urban ecosystems) compared with nearby undisturbed habitats. The magnitude of this effect varies taxonomically and is strongest for rodent, bat and passerine bird zoonotic host species, which may be one factor that underpins the global importance of these taxa as zoonotic reservoirs. We further show that mammal species that harbour more pathogens overall (either human-shared or non-human-shared) are more likely to occur in human-managed ecosystems, suggesting that these trends may be mediated by ecological or life-history traits that influence both host status and tolerance to human disturbance5,6. Our results suggest that global changes in the mode and the intensity of land use are creating expanding hazardous interfaces between people, livestock and wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic disease.},

We investigated the relationship between human alteration of the environment and the occurrence of generalist and synanthropic rodent species in relation to the diversity and prevalence of rodent-borne pathogens in Southeast Asia, a hotspot of threatened and endangered species, and a foci of emerging infectious diseases. We used data from an extensive pathogen survey of rodents from seven sites in mainland Southeast Asia in conjunction with past and present land cover analyses. At low spatial resolutions, we found that rodent-borne pathogen richness is negatively associated with increasing urbanization, characterized by increased habitat fragmentation, agriculture cover and deforestation. However, at a finer spatial resolution, we found that some major pathogens are favored by environmental characteristics associated with human alteration including irrigation, habitat fragmentation, and increased agricultural land cover. In addition, synanthropic rodents, many of which are important pathogen reservoirs, were associated with fragmented and human-dominated landscapes, which may ultimately enhance the opportunities for zoonotic transmission and human infection by some pathogens.},

	abstract = {Norway and black rats (Rattus norvegicus and Rattus rattus) are ubiquitous urban pests, inhabiting cities worldwide. Despite their close association with people, urban rats remain difficult to control. This can be attributed to a general lack of information on basic rat ecology to inform management efforts. In this systematic review and narrative synthesis, we collate the published literature to provide a comprehensive description of what is known about urban rat movement, including information on home range, site fidelity, dispersal, movement patterns, barriers to, and factors impacting, movement. We also discuss the methodologies used to track and infer rat movement, as well as the advantages and limitations of employing these techniques. Our review suggests that the distances travelled by urban rats are location-specific, determined by local resource availability and barriers to movement such as roadways. Although roads may impede rat movement, genetic techniques suggest that rats traverse roadways more often than revealed by capture-based tools, while long-distance dispersal events can maintain connectivity among distant populations. Because rat movement patterns are related to the transmission of rat-associated pathogens and the success of rodent control programs, these results have implications for both public health and pest control efforts. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of understanding local rat movement patterns in order to devise and deploy efficient and effective rat mitigation initiatives in urban centers.},

	abstract = {Zoonotic pathogens and parasites that are transmitted from vertebrates to humans are a major public health risk with high associated global economic costs. The spread of these pathogens and risk of transmission accelerate with recent anthropogenic land-use changes (LUC) such as deforestation, urbanisation, and agricultural intensification, factors that are expected to increase in the future due to human population expansion and increasing demand for resources. We systematically review the literature on anthropogenic LUC and zoonotic diseases, highlighting the most prominent mammalian reservoirs and pathogens, and identifying avenues for future research. The majority of studies were global reviews that did not focus on specific taxa. South America and Asia were the most-studied regions, while the most-studied LUC was urbanisation. Livestock were studied more within the context of agricultural intensification, carnivores with urbanisation and helminths, bats with deforestation and viruses, and primates with habitat fragmentation and protozoa. Research into specific animal reservoirs has improved our understanding of how the spread of zoonotic diseases is affected by LUC. The behaviour of hosts can be altered when their habitats are changed, impacting the pathogens they carry and the probability of disease spreading to humans. Understanding this has enabled the identification of factors that alter the risk of emergence (such as virulence, pathogen diversity, and ease of transmission). Yet, many pathogens and impacts of LUC other than urbanisation have been understudied. Predicting how zoonotic diseases emerge and spread in response to anthropogenic LUC requires more empirical and data synthesis studies that link host ecology and responses with pathogen ecology and disease spread. The link between anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment and the recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to understand how anthropogenic LUC affects the risk of spillover to humans and spread of zoonotic diseases originating in mammals.},

Nicotine established a stable interaction with the conserved amino acid residues: Asp382, Gly405, His378 and Tyr385 through His401 of the soluble ACE2 that seals its interaction with the INS1. Also, nicotine binding has significantly reduced the affinity score of ACE2 with INS1 to -12.6 kcal/mol (versus -15.7 kcal/mol without nicotine) and the interface area to 1933.6 square Angstrom (versus 2057.3 square Angstrom without nicotine). Nicotine exhibited a higher binding affinity score with ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complex with -6.33 kcal/mol (Vs -5.24 kcal/mol without SARS-CoV-2) and a lowered inhibitory contant value of 22.95 micromolar (Vs 151.69 micromolar without SARS-CoV). Eventhough ACE2 is not a potential receptor for nicotine binding in the healthy people, in COVID19 patients, it may exhibit better binding affinity with the ACE2 receptor.

Influenza is a common cause of severe respiratory illness, but risk factors for hospitalisation in low income settings with a high HIV prevalence are not well described. We aimed to assess risk factors associated with influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) hospitalisation in South Africa.
Methods
We conducted a case-population study using data on risk conditions in patients hospitalised with SARI and the national prevalence of these conditions. Data on hospitalised cases were from the national SARI surveillance program while data on the referent population were from the latest national census or health and demographic surveillance surveys.
Findings
From 2009 to 2012, we identified 3646 (7.9\%) of 46,031 enrolled cases of SARI that were associated with influenza infection. Risk factors associated with hospitalisation included previous history of smoking [case-population ratio (CPR) 3.82, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.5–4.16], HIV infection (CPR 3.61, 95\% CI 3.5–3.71), asthma (CPR 2.45, 95\% CI 2.19–2.73), previous history of hospital admission in the past 12months (CPR 2.07, 95\% CI 1.92–2.23), and tuberculosis (CPR 1.85, 95\% CI 1.68–2.02). When stratified by age, there is increased risk of hospitalisation in those ⩽5yearsof age (CPR 3.07, 95\% CI 2.93–3.21) and among those 35yearsof age and above (CPR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.28–1.18). Male sex (CPR 0.85, 95\% CI 0.82–0.88) and completion of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination schedule in children {\textless}5yearsof age (CPR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.71–0.77) were associated with decreased risk of hospitalisation.
Conclusion
These results identify groups at high-risk for severe influenza who should be considered potential targets for influenza vaccination in South Africa and similar settings.},

	abstract = {Objectives
In this review, we describe surveillance programmes reporting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and resistance genes in bacterial isolates from livestock and meat and compare them with those relevant for human health.
Methods
Publications on AMR in European countries were assessed. PubMed was reviewed and AMR monitoring programmes were identified from reports retrieved by Internet searches and by contacting national authorities in EU/European Economic Area (EEA) member states.
Results
Three types of systems were identified: EU programmes, industry-funded supranational programmes and national surveillance systems. The mandatory EU-financed programme has led to some harmonization in national monitoring and provides relevant information on AMR and extended-spectrum β-lactamase/AmpC– and carbapenemase-producing bacteria. At the national level, AMR surveillance systems in livestock apply heterogeneous sampling, testing and reporting modalities, resulting in results that cannot be compared. Most reports are not publicly available or are written in a local language. The industry-funded monitoring systems undertaken by the Centre Européen d’Etudes pour la Santé Animale (CEESA) examines AMR in bacteria in food-producing animals.
Conclusions
Characterization of AMR genes in livestock is applied heterogeneously among countries. Most antibiotics of human interest are included in animal surveillance, although results are difficult to compare as a result of lack of representativeness of animal samples. We suggest that EU/EEA countries provide better uniform AMR monitoring and reporting in livestock and link them better to surveillance systems in humans. Reducing the delay between data collection and publication is also important to allow prompt identification of new resistance patterns.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives: To investigate severe COVID-19 risk by occupational group. Methods: Baseline UK Biobank data (2006-10) for England were linked to SARS-CoV-2 test results from Public Health England (16 March to 26 July 2020). Included participants were employed or self-employed at baseline, alive and aged less than 65 years in 2020. Poisson regression models adjusted sequentially for baseline demographic, socioeconomic, work-related, health, and lifestyle-related risk factors to assess risk ratios (RRs) for testing positive in hospital or death due to COVID-19 by three occupational classification schemes (including Standard Occupation Classification 2000). Results: Of 120,075 participants, 271 had severe COVID-19. Relative to non-essential workers, healthcare workers (RR 7.43, 95\% CI:5.52,10.00), social and education workers (RR 1.84, 95\% CI:1.21,2.82) and other essential workers (RR=1.60, 95\% CI:1.05,2.45) had higher risk of severe COVID-19. Using more detailed groupings, medical support staff (RR 8.70, 95\% CI:4.87,15.55), social care (RR 2.46, 95\% CI:1.47,4.14) and transport workers (RR= 2.20, 95\% CI:1.21,4.00) had highest risk within the broader groups. Compared to white non-essential workers, non-white non-essential workers had a higher risk (RR 3.27, 95\% CI: 1.90,5.62) and non-white essential workers had the highest risk (RR 8.34, 95\% CI:5.17,13.47). Using SOC2000 major groups, associate professional and technical occupations, personal service occupations and plant and machine operatives had higher risk, compared to managers and senior officials. Conclusions: Essential workers have higher risk of severe COVID-19. These findings underscore the need for national and organizational policies and practices that protect and support workers with elevated risk of severe COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective The impact of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) conditions is not clearly understood. To explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 susceptibility and survival in this patient group, we conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study. Design We interrogated linked electronic health records for patients diagnosed with HPB diseases in East London since 2008 (n=15 586), and identified 212 confirmed COVID-19 cases between February 12 and June 12, 2020. We conducted risk analyses to identify the effect of demographics, comorbidities and associated medication use, and lifestyle factors and with appropriate adjustment for gender, ethnicity, age group and HPB diagnoses on COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Results We observed an increased risk of COVID-19 for men (Relative Risk, RR=1.59; 95\% CI 1.21 to 2.09) and Black ethnicity (RR=2.2; 95\% CI 1.5 to 3.18). Substance mis-users were at more risk of infection, so were patients on Vitamin D treatment. The higher risks associated with South Asian ethnicity, patients with pre-existing non-malignant pancreatic or liver conditions, age\&gt;70, and past smokers were due to co-existing comorbidities; surprisingly current smokers were associated with a lower risk. Increased mortality risk was observed for Black ethnicity (RR=2.4; 95\% CI 1.35 to 3.48), and patients with a pre-existing kidney condition (RR=2.13; 95\% CI 1.16 to 3.55) - particularly when accompanied with an acute episode of renal complications (RR=2.74; 95\% CI 1.32 to 5.13). Conclusions This large multi-ethnic population-based study of HPB patients shows a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 for male gender, Black ethnicity, medical co-morbidities, and substance mis-users. Particular attention should be paid to patients with a pre-existing kidney disease for further renal insult to prevent fatality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Although models have been developed for predicting severity of COVID-19 based on the medical history of patients, simplified risk prediction models with good accuracy could be more practical. In this study, we examined utility of simpler models for estimating risk of hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 and mortality of these patients based on demographic characteristics (sex, age, race, median household income based on zip code) and smoking status of 12,347 patients who tested positive at Mass General Brigham centers. The corresponding electronic health records were queried from 02/26/2020 to 07/14/2020 to construct derivation and validation cohorts. The derivation cohort was used to fit a generalized linear model for estimating risk of hospitalization within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality within approximately 3 months for the hospitalized patients. On the validation cohort, the model resulted in c-statistics of 0.77 [95\% CI: 0.73-0.80] for hospitalization outcome, and 0.72 [95\% CI: 0.69-0.74] for mortality among hospitalized patients. Higher risk was associated with older age, male sex, black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, and current/past smoking status. The model can be applied to predict risk of hospitalization and mortality, and could aid decision making when detailed medical history of patients is not easily available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Aim To estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in May-June 2020 after the lockdown in adults living in three regions in France and to identify the associated risk factors. Methods Participants in a survey on COVID-19 from an existing consortium of three general adult population cohorts living in the Ile-de-France (IDF) or Grand Est (GE), two regions with high rate of COVID-19, or in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine (NA), with a low rate, were asked to take a dried-blood spot (DBS) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies assessment. The primary outcome was a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG result against the spike protein of the virus (ELISA-S). The secondary outcomes were a positive ELISA IgG against the nucleocapsid protein (ELISA-NP), anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies titers \&gt;=40 (SN), and predicted positivity obtained from a multiple imputation model (MI). Prevalence estimates were adjusted using sampling weights and post-stratification methods. Findings Between May 4, 2020 and June 23, 2020, 16,000 participants were asked to provide DBS, and 14,628 were included in the analysis, 983 with a positive ELISA-S, 511 with a positive ELISA-NP, 424 with SN\&gt;=40 and 941 (Standard Deviation=31) with a positive MI. Adjusted estimates of seroprevalence (positive ELISA-S) were 10.0\% (95\%CI 9.1\%;10.9\%) in IDF, 9.0\% (95\%CI 7.7\%; 10.2\%) in GE and 3.1\% (95\%CI 2.4\%; 3.7\%), in NA. The adjusted prevalence of positive ELISA-NP, SN and MI were 5.7\%, 5.0\% and 10.0\% in IDF, 6.0\%, 4.3\% and 8.6\% in GE, and 0.6\%, 1.3\% and 2.5\% in NA, respectively. A higher seroprevalence was observed in younger participants and when at least one child or adolescent lived in the same household. A lower seroprevalence was observed in smokers compared to non-smokers. Interpretation At the end of the lockdown the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG or neutralizing antibodies remained low in the French adult population, even in regions with high reported rates of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn\&rsquo;t find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (\&gt;60 vs \&lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker\&rsquo;s lung compared to non-smoker\&rsquo;s lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.},

Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5–7. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6\% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96\% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as SARS-CoV.},

In this study, we assessed the quality of smoking status captured in an electronic health record from a large academic medical center. We analyzed data from structured notes, finding that smoking status was documented in 98\% of 64,451 hospital encounters in 2016. 32\% hospital encounters had discrepant documentation, and 54.5\% of patients had implausible changes (e.g., changes from “current smoker” to “never smoker”). Overall, only 2.9\% of patients were documented as active smokers, but 36.4\% were documented as “unknown” or had discrepancies in their smoking status. These results suggest that patients that smoke are not appropriately identified. Centralized documentation with clinically actionable smoking status categories and implementation of patient-facing tools that allow patients to directly record their information could improve data quality of smoking status.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background Observational studies have consistently described poor clinical outcomes and increased ICU mortality in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who require mechanical ventilation (MV). Our study describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU in the largest health care system in the state of Florida, United States. Methods Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to ICU due to severe COVID-19 in AdventHealth health system in Orlando, Florida from March 11th until May 18th, 2020. Patients were characterized based on demographics, baseline comorbidities, severity of illness, medical management including experimental therapies, laboratory markers and ventilator parameters. Major clinical outcomes analyzed at the end of the study period were: hospital and ICU length of stay, MV-related mortality and overall hospital mortality of ICU patients. Results Out of total of 1283 patients with COVID-19, 131 (10.2\%) met criteria for ICU admission (median age: 61 years [interquartile range \{IQR\}, 49.5-71.5]; 35.1\% female). Common comorbidities were hypertension (84; 64.1\%), and diabetes (54; 41.2\%). Of the 131 ICU patients, 109 (83.2\%) required MV and 9 (6.9\%) received ECMO. Lower positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) were observed in survivors [9.2 (7.7-10.4)] vs non-survivors [10 (9.1-12.9] p= 0.004]. Compared to non-survivors, survivors had a longer MV length of stay (LOS) [14 (IQR 8-22) vs 8.5 (IQR 5-10.8) p\&lt; 0.001], Hospital LOS [21 (IQR 13-31) vs 10 (7-1) p\&lt; 0.001] and ICU LOS [14 (IQR 7-24) vs 9.5 (IQR 6-11), p \&lt; 0.001]. The overall hospital mortality and MV-related mortality were 19.8\% and 23.8\% respectively. After exclusion of hospitalized patients, the hospital and MV-related mortality rates were 21.6\% and 26.5\% respectively. Conclusions Our study demonstrates an important improvement in mortality of patients with severe COVID-19 who required ICU admission and MV in comparison to previous observational reports and emphasize the importance of standard of care measures in the management of COVID-19.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rational: Recently, a new Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) scale is recommended in the current COVID-19 pandemic. It is proposed that it could be used to display direct retrieval and the functional sequelae of COVID-19. Aim of the study: To assess the Post COVID-19 functional status in Egypt and to evaluate if age, gender, comorbidities have any effect on functional limitations in recovered COVID-19 patients. Patients and methods: A total of 444 registered confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. They were interviewed in our follow-up clinics or by calls and filled an Arabic translated PCFS scale in paper or online forms as well as their demographic and clinical data. Results: 80\% of COVID-19 recovered cases have diverse degrees of functional restrictions ranging from negligible (63.1\%), slight (14.4\%), moderate (2\%) to severe (0.5\%) based on PCFS. Furthermore, there was a substantial variance between the score of PCFS with age (P= 0.003), gender (P= 0.014), the duration since the onset of the symptoms of COVID-19 (P \&lt;0.001), need for oxygen supplementation (P\&lt;0.001), need for ICU admittance (P= 0.003), previous periodic influenza vaccination (P\&lt;0.001), smoking status (P \&lt; 0.001) and lastly the presence of any comorbid disorder (P \&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Most of the COVID-19 recovered cases have diverse degrees of functional restrictions ranging from negligible to severe based on PCFS. These restrictions were affected by age, gender, periodic influenza vaccination, smoking, duration since symptoms onset, need for oxygen or ICU admittance, and lastly the presence of coexisting comorbidity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}OBJECTIVE To identify the different subpopulations that are susceptible for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and hospitalisation or death due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Catalonia, Spain. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Data collected from the Catalan Health Surveillance System (CatSalut) in Catalonia, a region of Spain. PARTICIPANTS Using data collected between 1 March and 1 June 2020, we conducted the following comparative analyses: people infected by SARS-CoV-2 (328 892) vs Catalonia9s entire population (7 699 568); COVID-19 cases who required hospitalisation (37 638) vs cases who did not require hospitalisation (291 254); and COVID-19 cases who died during the study period vs cases who did not die during the study period (12 287). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Three clinical outcomes related to COVID-19 (infection, hospitalisation, or death). We analysed sociodemographic and environment variables (such as residing in a nursing home) and the presence of previous comorbidities. RESULTS A total of 328 892 cases were considered to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (4.27\% of total population). The main risk factors for the diagnostic were: female gender (risk ratio [RR] =1.49; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] =1.48-1.50), age (45-64 years old; RR=1.02; 95\% CI=1.01-1.03), high comorbidity burden (GMA index) (RR=3.03; 95\% CI=2.97-3.09), reside in a nursing home (RR=11.82; 95\% CI=11.66-11.99), and smoking (RR=1.06; 95\% CI=1.05-1.07). During the study period, there were 37 638 (11.4 \%) hospitalisations due to COVID-19, and the risk factors were: male gender (RR=1.45; 95\% CI=1.43-1.48), age \&gt; 65 (RR=2.38; 95\% CI=2.28-2.48), very low individual income (RR=1.03; 95\% CI=0.97-1.08), and high burden of comorbidities (GMA index) (RR=5.15; 95\% CI=4.89-5.42). The individual comorbidities with higher burden were obesity (RR=1.23; 95\% CI=1.20-1.25), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR=1.19; 95\% CI=1.15-1.22), heart failure (RR=1.19; 95\% CI=1.16-1.22), diabetes mellitus (RR=1.07; 95\% CI=1.04-1.10), and neuro-psychiatric comorbidities (RR=1.06; 95\% CI=1.03-1.10). A total of 12 287 deaths (3.73\%) were attributed to COVID-19, and the main risk factors were: male gender (RR=1.73; 95\% CI=1.67-1.81), age \&gt; 65 (RR=37.45; 95\% CI=29.23-47.93), residing in a nursing home (RR=9.22; 95\% CI=8.81-9.65), and high burden of comorbidities (GMA index) (RR=5.25; 95\% CI=4.60-6.00). The individual comorbidities with higher burden were: heart failure (RR=1.21; 95\% CI=1.16-1.22), chronic kidney disease (RR=1.17; 95\% CI=1.13-1.22), and diabetes mellitus (RR=1.10; 95\% CI=1.06-1.14). These results did not change significantly when we considered only PCR-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS Female gender, age between 45 to 64 years old, high burden of comorbidities, and factors related to environment (nursing home) play a relevant role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. In addition, we found risk factors for hospitalisation and death due to COVID-19 that had not been described to date, including comorbidity burden, neuro-psychiatric disorders, and very low individual income. This study supports interventions for transmission control beyond stratify-and-shield strategies focused only on protecting those at risk of death. Future COVID-19 studies should examine the role of gender, the burden of comorbidities, and socioeconomic status in disease transmission, and should determine its relationship to workplaces, especially healthcare centres and nursing homes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives: To analyze the mortality associated with ethnicity, particularly of Indigenous peoples, in a large sample of patients with COVID-19 in Mexico. Design: National, cross-sectional study. Setting: Mexico. Participants: 416546 adult patients; 4178 Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 were the primary population under study. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was mortality from COVID-19 up to August 3rd, 2020. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios while adjusting for confounders. Results: Among all patients with COVID-19, whether hospitalized or not, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died compared to non-Indigenous people (16.5\% vs 11.1\%, respectively). Among hospitalized patients, a higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died (37.1\%) compared to non-Indigenous peoples (36.3\%). Deaths outside the hospital were also higher among Indigenous peoples (3.7\% vs 1.7\%). A higher proportion of Indigenous peoples died in both the private and public health care sectors. The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was 1.13 (95\% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.24). The adjusted odds ratio for COVID-19 mortality among Indigenous peoples with COVID-19 was higher among those who received only ambulatory care (1.55, 95\% confidence interval 1.24 to 1.92). Conclusions: In the large sample of patients with COVID-19, the findings suggest that Indigenous peoples in Mexico have a higher risk of death from COVID-19, especially outside the hospital. These findings suggest Indigenous peoples lack access to care more so than non-Indigenous people during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. More research is needed regarding the impact of the COVID-19 among racial and ethnic minorities in Mexico.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We conducted a prospective single-arm open-label phase II clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Convalescent plasma with sufficient IgG titer (1:320) obtained from recovered donors was administered to adult patients with either severe or critical COVID-19 illness. Primary outcomes were adverse events in association with plasma administration, and hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included disease progression, recovery, length of stay, and hospital discharge. Of the 38 patients included in the analysis, 24 (63\%) recovered and were discharged, and 14 (37\%) died. Patients who received convalescent plasma early in the disease course (severe illness group) as compared to the patients that received convalescent plasma later in disease progression (critical illness group) had significantly lower hospital mortality 13\% vs 55\% (p\&lt;0.02) and shorter mean hospital length of stay 15.4 vs 33 days (p\&lt;0.01). One patient experienced a transient transfusion reaction. No other adverse effects of convalescent plasma infusion were observed. Our results suggest that convalescent plasma is safe and has the potential for positive impact on clinical outcomes including recovery and survival if given to patients early in the course of COVID-19 disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Introduction: On the basis of the preliminary report from the RECOVERY trial, the use of dexamethasone or alternative corticosteroids (CS) is currently recommended in severe COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen. However, last updated recommendations have not taken a position either for or against the use of other immunomodulators such as tocilizumab (TCZ), with or without CS, since results are still limited. Methods: From March 17 to April 7, 2020, a real-world observational retrospective analysis was conducted at our 750-bed university hospital to study the characteristics and risk factors for mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ, with or without CS, in addition to standard of care (SOC). Data were obtained from routine clinical practice, stored in electronic medical records. The main outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Results: A total of 1,092 COVID-19 patients were admitted during the study period. Of them, 186 (17\%) were treated with TCZ, of which 129 (87.8\%) in combination with CS. Of the total 186, 155 (83.3 \%) patients were receiving non-invasive ventilation when TCZ, with or without CS was initiated. Mean time from symptoms onset and hospital admission to TCZ use was 12 (SD 4.3) and 4.3 days (SD 3.4), respectively. Overall, 147 (79\%) survived and 39 (21\%) died. By multivariate analysis, mortality was associated with older age (HR=1.09, p\&lt;0.001), chronic heart failure (HR=4.4, p=0.003), and chronic liver disease (HR=4.69, p=0.004). The use of CS, in combination with TCZ, was the main protective factor against mortality (HR=0.26, p\&lt;0.001) in such severe COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ. No serious superinfections were observed after a 30-day follow-up. Conclusions: In severe COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ due to systemic host-immune inflammatory response syndrome, the use of CS in combined therapy with TCZ, was the main protective factor against in-hospital mortality.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective To establish the prevalence and risk factors for the development of suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the United Kingdom (UK). Design Cross-sectional observational study. Setting UK-based primary and secondary care. Participants HCWs aged ≥18 years working between 1 February and 25 May 2020. Main outcome measures A composite endpoint of laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, or self-isolation or hospitalisation due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Results Of 6152 eligible responses, the composite endpoint was present in 1806 (29.4\%) HCWs, of whom 49 (0.8\%) were hospitalised, 459 (7.5\%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 1776 (28.9\%) reported self-isolation. The strongest risk factor associated with the presence of the primary composite endpoint was increasing frequency of contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE): ″Never″ (reference), ″Rarely″ (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, (95\% confidence interval: 0.87 to 1.29)), ″Sometimes″ (1.7 (1.37 to 2.10)), ″Often″ (1.84 (1.28 to 2.63)), ″Always″ (2.93, (1.75 to 5.06)). Additionally, several comorbidities (cancer, respiratory disease, and obesity); working in a ′doctors′ role; using public transportation for work; regular contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients; and lack of PPE were also associated with the presence of the primary endpoint. 1382 (22.5\%) HCWs reported lacking access to PPE items while having clinical contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Overall, between 11,870 and 21,158 days of self-isolation were required by the cohort, equalling approximately 71 to 127 working days lost per 1000 working days. Conclusions Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 was more common in HCWs than in the general population. Risk factors included inadequate PPE, which was reported by nearly a quarter of HCWs. Governments and policymakers must ensure adequate PPE is available as well as developing strategies to mitigate risk for high-risk HCWs during future COVID-19 waves.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our objective was to identify prevalence of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes and quantify its association with COVID-19 disease course. Research Design and Methods: In this observational cohort study, all consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to John H Stroger Jr. Hospital, Chicago, IL from March 15, 2020 to May 15, 2020 were included. The primary outcome was hospital mortality and the main predictor was hyperglycemia (any blood glucose ≥7.78 mmol/L during hospitalization). Results: Of 403 COVID-19 patients studied, 228 (57\%) developed hyperglycemia. Of these, 83 (21\%) had hyperglycemia without diabetes. A total of 51 (12.7\%) patients died. Compared to the reference group no-diabetes/no-hyperglycemia patients the no-diabetes/hyperglycemia patients showed higher mortality (1.8\% versus 20.5\%, adjusted odds ratio 21.94 (95\% confidence interval 4.04-119.0), p \&lt; 0.001); improved prediction of death (p=0.0162) and faster progression to death (p=0.0051). Hyperglycemia within the first 24 and 48 hours was also significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio 2.15 and 3.31, respectively). Further, compared to the same reference group, no-diabetes/hyperglycemia patients had higher risk of ICU admission (p\&lt;0.001), mechanical ventilation (p\&lt;0.001) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (p\&lt;0.001) and a longer hospital stay in survivors (p\&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Hyperglycemia in the absence of diabetes was common (21\% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients) and was associated with an increased risk of and faster progression to death. Development of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients who do not have diabetes is an early indicator of poor prognosis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Purpose: To examine the risk factors for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study including 432 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to three medical centers in Hubei province from January 1st to April 10th 2020. Primary outcomes included ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and death occurring while hospitalized or within 30 days. Results: Of the 432 confirmed patients, 9.5\% were admitted to the ICU, 27.3\% required mechanical ventilation, and 33.1\% died. Total leukocyte count was higher in survivors compared with those who died (8.9 vs 4.8 x 109/l), but lymphocyte counts were lower (0.6 vs 1.0 x 109/l). D-dimer was significantly higher in patients who died compared to survivors (6.0ug/l vs 1.0ug/l, p\&lt;0.0001. This was also seen when comparing mechanically versus non-mechanically-ventilated patients. Other significant differences were seen in AST, ALT, LDH, total bilirubin and creating kinase. The following were associated with increased odds of death: age \&gt; 65 years (adjusted hazard ratio (HR 2.09, 95\% CI 1.02-4.05), severe disease at baseline (5.02, 2.05-12.29), current smoker (1.67, 1.37-2.02), temperature \&gt;39o C at baseline (2.68, 1.88-4.23), more than one comorbidity (2.12, 1.62-3.09), bilateral patchy shadowing on chest CT or X-ray (3.74, 1.78-9.62) and organ failure (6.47, 1.97-26.23). The following interventions were associated with higher CFR: glucocorticoids (1.60, 1.04-2.30), ICU admission (4.92, 1.37-17.64) and mechanical ventilation (2.35, 1.14-4.82). Conclusion: Demographics, including age over 65 years, current smoker, diabetes, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease, were associated with increased risk of mortality. Mortality was also associated with glucocorticoid use, mechanical ventilation and ICU admission. Take-Home Message: COVID-19 patients with risk factors were more likely to be admitted into ICU and more likely to require mechanical ventilation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We conducted a national retrospective cohort in two different sets of patients from the Mexican COVID-19 Epidemiologic Surveillance Study. To develop the model, we included 264,026 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between February 28 and May 30, 2020. To validate the model, 592,160 patients studied between June 1 and July 23, 2020 were included. Patients with a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 and complete unduplicated data were eligible. Demographic and patient history variables were analyzed through Multivariable Cox regression models to evaluate predictors to be included in the prognostic scoring system called PH-Covid19. 83,779 patients were included to develop the model; 100,000, to validate the model. Eight predictors (age, sex, diabetes, COPD, immunosuppression, hypertension, obesity, and CKD) were included in the PH-Covid19 scoring system (range of values: -2 to 25 points). The predictive model has a discrimination of death of 0.8 (95\%CI:0.796-0.804). The PH-Covid19 scoring system was developed and validated in Mexican patients to aid clinicians to stratify patients with COVID-19 at risk of fatal outcomes, allowing for better and efficient use of resources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Risk stratification of COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission is key for their successful treatment and efficient utilization of hospital resources. Objective: To evaluate the risk factors associated with ventilation need and mortality. Design, setting and participants: We established a retrospective cohort of COVID-19 patients from Mass General Brigham hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and admission laboratory data were obtained from electronic medical records of patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 before May 19th, 2020. Using patients admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH, derivation cohort), multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to construct the Ventilation in COVID Estimator (VICE) and Death in COVID Estimator (DICE) risk scores. Measurements: The primary outcomes were ventilation status and death. Results: The entire cohort included 1042 patients (median age, 64 years; 56.8\% male). The derivation and validation cohorts for the risk scores included 578 and 464 patients, respectively. We found seven factors to be independently predictive for ventilation requirement (diabetes mellitus, dyspnea, alanine aminotransferase, troponin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and lactate dehydrogenase), and 10 factors to be predictors of in-hospital mortality (age, sex, diabetes mellitus, chronic statin use, albumin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, mean corpuscular volume, platelet count, and procalcitonin). Using these factors, we constructed the VICE and DICE risk scores, which performed with C-statistics of at least 0.8 in our cohorts. Importantly, the chronic use of a statin was associated with protection against death due to COVID-19. The VICE and DICE score calculators have been placed on an interactive website freely available to the public (https://covid-calculator.com/). Limitations: One potential limitation is the modest sample sizes in both our derivation and validation cohorts. Conclusion: The risk scores developed in this study may help clinicians more appropriately determine which COVID-19 patients will need to be managed with greater intensity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives To determine the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and the incidence of seroconversion in the first month of follow-up among interns, residents, and medical doctors attending patients at a University Hospital, to explore for associations of seroprevalence and seroconversion with risk factors and symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and to explore the concordance of CLA, LFA, and ELFA. Design or methods We conducted a cross-sectional and a prospective study among medical doctors and medical trainees at Hospital Universitario San Ignacio in Bogota (Colombia) during June, July, and August to assess seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in this population was performed using CLA IgG for SARS-CoV-2. LFA IgG and IgM and ELFA IgM were also determined to explore concordance with CLA IgG. Results At baseline, 8 (2.28\% 95\%CI 1.16-4.43\%) individuals were IgG positive for SARS-CoV-2 by CLA. At the end of the study, 21 (5.98\% 95\%CI 3.94-8.97\%) individuals seroconverted by CLA IgG. In all, 29 individuals had IgG by CLA and of these 11 (3.13\% 95\%CI 1.76-5.52\%) were asymptomatic. No associations with risk factors for infection were identified. CLA had moderate concordance with LFA IgG and ELFA, but minimal with LFA IgM. Conclusions Our report is one of the first in Latina America on seroprevalence and seroconversion rates in medical healthcare workers. It emphasizes the importance of avoiding focusing only on symptomatic individuals to screen this population for SARS-CoV-2 infection, since of all individuals that have evidence of previous infection many (37.93\%) may be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic and may contribute to infection/disease spread.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objective: To estimate the prevalence of disability and anxiety in Covid-19 survivors at discharge from hospital and analyze relative risk by exposures. Design: Multi-center retrospective cohort study. Setting: Twenty-eight hospitals located in eight provinces of China. Methods: A total of 432 survivors with laboratory-confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection participated in this study. At discharge, we assessed instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) with Lawton9s IADL scale, dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) with the Barthel Index, and anxiety with Zung9s self-reported anxiety scale. Exposures included comorbidity, smoking, setting (Hubei vs. others), disease severity, symptoms, and length of hospital stay. Other risk factors considered were age, gender, and ethnicity (Han vs. Tibetan). Results: Prevalence of at least one IADL problem was 36.81\% (95\% CI: 32.39-41.46). ADL dependence was present in 16.44\% (95\% CI: 13.23-20.23) and 28.70\% (95\% CI: 24.63- 33.15) were screened positive for clinical anxiety. Adjusted risk ratio (RR) of IADL limitations (RR 2.48, 95\% CI: 1.80-3.40), ADL dependence (RR 2.07, 95\% CI 1.15-3.76), and probable clinical anxiety (RR 2.53, 95\% CI 1.69-3.79) were consistently elevated in survivors with severe Covid-19. Age was an additional independent risk factor for IADL limitations and ADL dependence; and setting (Hubei) for IADL limitations and anxiety. Tibetan ethnicity was a protective factor for anxiety but a risk factor for IADL limitations. Conclusion: A significant proportion of Covid-19 survivors had disability and anxiety at discharge from hospital. Health systems need to be prepared for an additional burden resulting from rehabilitation needs of Covid-19 survivors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Cancer patients are a vulnerable population postulated to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection. Increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in cancer patients may be attributable to age, comorbidities, smoking, healthcare exposure, and cancer treatments, and partially to the cancer itself. Most studies to date have focused on hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of the association between cancer and COVID-19 severity. We compared outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 323 patients enrolled prior to the pandemic in a large academic biobank (n=67 cancer patients and n=256 non-cancer patients). After adjusting for demographics, smoking status, and comorbidities, a diagnosis of cancer was independently associated with higher odds of hospitalization (OR 2.16, 95\% CI 1.12-4.18) and 30-day mortality (OR 5.67, CI 1.49-21.59). These associations were primarily driven by patients with active cancer.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Objectives: Mortality risk scores, such as SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65, are quick, effective tools for communicating a patient9s prognosis and guiding therapeutic decisions. Most use simple calculations that can be performed by hand. While several COVID-19 specific risk scores exist, they lack the ease of use of these simpler scores. The objectives of this study were (1) to design, validate, and calibrate a simple, easy-to-use mortality risk score for COVID-19 patients and (2) to recalibrate SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 in a hospitalized COVID-19 population. Design: Retrospective cohort study incorporating demographic, clinical, laboratory, and admissions data from electronic health records. Setting: Multi-hospital health system in New York City. Five hospitals were included: one quaternary care facility, one tertiary care facility, and three community hospitals. Participants: Patients (n=4840) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection who were admitted between March 1 and April 28, 2020. Main outcome measures: Gray9s K-sample test for the cumulative incidence of a competing risk was used to assess and rank 48 different variables9 associations with mortality. Candidate variables were added to the composite score using DeLong9s test to evaluate their effect on predictive performance (AUC) of in-hospital mortality. Final AUCs for the new score, SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 were assessed on an independent test set. Results: Of 48 variables investigated, 36 (75\%) displayed significant (p\&lt;0.05 by Gray9s test) associations with mortality. The variables selected for the final score were (1) oxygen support level, (2) troponin, (3) blood urea nitrogen, (4) lymphocyte percentage, (5) Glasgow Coma Score, and (6) age. The new score, COBALT, outperforms SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 at predicting mortality in this COVID-19 population: AUCs for initial, maximum, and mean COBALT scores were 0.81, 0.91, and 0.92, compared to 0.77, 0.87, and 0.87 for SOFA. We provide COVID-19 specific mortality estimates at all score levels for COBALT, SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65. Conclusions: The COBALT score provides a simple way to estimate mortality risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with superior performance to SOFA and other scores currently in widespread use. Evaluation of SOFA, qSOFA, and CURB-65 in this population highlights the importance of recalibrating mortality risk scores when they are used under novel conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study9s approach to score design could also be applied in other contexts to create simple, practical and high-performing mortality risk scores.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Social network analysis has achieved remarkable popularity in disease ecology, and is sometimes carried out without investigating spatial heterogeneity. Many investigations into sociality and disease may nevertheless be subject to cryptic spatial variation, so ignoring spatial processes can limit inference regarding disease dynamics. Disease analyses can gain breadth, power, and reliability from incorporating both spatial and social behavioural data. However, the tools for collecting and analysing these data simultaneously can be complex and unintuitive, and it is often unclear when spatial variation must be accounted for. These difficulties contribute to the scarcity of simultaneous spatial-social network analyses in disease ecology thus far. Here, we detail scenarios in disease ecology that benefit from spatial-social analysis. We describe procedures for simultaneous collection of both spatial and social data, and we outline statistical approaches that can control for and estimate spatial-social covariance in disease ecology analyses. We hope disease researchers will expand social network analyses to more often include spatial components and questions. These measures will increase the scope of such analyses, allowing more accurate model estimates, better inference of transmission modes, susceptibility effects and contact scaling patterns, and ultimately more effective disease interventions.},

	abstract = {Many major human pathogens are multihost pathogens, able to infect other vertebrate species. Describing the general patterns of host–pathogen associations across pathogen taxa is therefore important to understand risk factors for human disease emergence. However, there is a lack of comprehensive curated databases for this purpose, with most previous efforts focusing on viruses. Here, we report the largest manually compiled host–pathogen association database, covering 2,595 bacteria and viruses infecting 2,656 vertebrate hosts. We also build a tree for host species using nine mitochondrial genes, giving a quantitative measure of the phylogenetic similarity of hosts. We find that the majority of bacteria and viruses are specialists infecting only a single host species, with bacteria having a significantly higher proportion of specialists compared to viruses. Conversely, multihost viruses have a more restricted host range than multihost bacteria. We perform multiple analyses of factors associated with pathogen richness per host species and the pathogen traits associated with greater host range and zoonotic potential. We show that factors previously identified as important for zoonotic potential in viruses—such as phylogenetic range, research effort, and being vector-borne—are also predictive in bacteria. We find that the fraction of pathogens shared between two hosts decreases with the phylogenetic distance between them. Our results suggest that host phylogenetic similarity is the primary factor for host-switching in pathogens.},

We examine a large real-world data set: the NEC CiteSeer database, a linked network of {\textgreater}250,000 papers. Tracking changes over time requires a clustering algorithm that produces clusters stable under small perturbations of the input data. However, small perturbations of the CiteSeer data lead to significant changes to most of the clusters. One reason for this is that the order in which papers within communities are combined is somewhat arbitrary. However, certain subsets of papers, called natural communities, correspond to real structure in the CiteSeer database and thus appear in any clustering. By identifying the subset of clusters that remain stable under multiple clustering runs, we get the set of natural communities that we can track over time. We demonstrate that such natural communities allow us to identify emerging communities and track temporal changes in the underlying structure of our network data.},

These connections can be critical for disease spread, as in the 2001 epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the UK. Here, the movement data are used to construct an individual-farm-based model of the initial spread of FMD in GB and determine the susceptibility of the GB livestock industry to future outbreaks under the current legislative requirements. Transmission through movements is modelled, with additional local spread unrelated to the known movements. Simulations show that movements can result in a large nationwide epidemic, but only if cattle are heavily involved, or the epidemic occurs in late summer or early autumn. Inclusion of random local spread can considerably increase epidemic size, but has only a small impact on the spatial extent of the disease. There is a geographical bias in the epidemic size reached, with larger epidemics originating in Scotland and the north of England than elsewhere.},

We conducted a systematic review 305 scientific articles investigating how specific types of anthropogenic land use change influence infectious disease dynamics. We summarized findings, highlighted common themes, and drew attention to neglected areas of research. There was an increase in publications on this topic over the last 30 years spanning diseases of humans, livestock, and wildlife, including a large number of zoonotic pathogens. Most papers (66.9\%) were observational, 30.8\% were review or concept papers, and few studies (2.3\%) were experimental in nature, with most studies focusing on vector-borne and/or multi-host pathogens. Common land use change types related to disease transmission were deforestation/forest fragmentation/habitat fragmentation, agricultural development/irrigation, and urbanization/suburbanization. In response to anthropogenic change, more than half of the studies (56.9\%) documented increased pathogen transmission, 10.4\% of studies observed decreased pathogen transmission, 30.4\% had variable and complex pathogen responses, and 2.4\% showed no detectable changes. Commonly reported mechanisms by which land use change altered infectious disease transmission included alteration of the vector, host, and pathogen niche, changes in host and vector community composition, changes in behavior or movement of vectors and/or hosts, altered spatial distribution of hosts and/or vectors, and socioeconomic factors, and environmental contamination. We discussed observed patterns in the literature and make suggestions for future research directions, emphasizing the importance of ecological and evolutionary theory to understand pathogen responses in changing landscapes.},

However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying their emergence remains rudimentary. Here we update a global database of emerging infectious disease (EID) events, create a novel measure of reporting effort, and fit boosted regression tree models to analyze the demographic, environmental and biological correlates of their occurrence. After accounting for reporting effort, we show that zoonotic EID risk is elevated in forested tropical regions experiencing land-use changes and where wildlife biodiversity (mammal species richness) is high. We present a new global hotspot map of spatial variation in our zoonotic EID risk index, and partial dependence plots illustrating relationships between events and predictors. Our results may help to improve surveillance and long-term EID monitoring programs, and design field experiments to test underlying mechanisms of zoonotic disease emergence.},

	abstract = {Bats are natural reservoirs of several important emerging viruses. Cross-species transmission appears to be quite common among bats, which may contribute to their unique reservoir potential. Therefore, understanding the importance of bats as reservoirs requires examining them in a community context rather than concentrating on individual species. Here, we use a network approach to identify ecological and biological correlates of cross-species virus transmission in bats and rodents, another important host group. We show that given our current knowledge the bat viral sharing network is more connected than the rodent network, suggesting viruses may pass more easily between bat species. We identify host traits associated with important reservoir species: gregarious bats are more likely to share more viruses and bats which migrate regionally are important for spreading viruses through the network. We identify multiple communities of viral sharing within bats and rodents and highlight potential species traits that can help guide studies of novel pathogen emergence.},

	abstract = {Urbanisation and agriculture cause declines for many wildlife, but some species benefit from novel resources, especially food, provided in human-dominated habitats. Resulting shifts in wildlife ecology can alter infectious disease dynamics and create opportunities for cross-species transmission, yet predicting host-pathogen responses to resource provisioning is challenging. Factors enhancing transmission, such as increased aggregation, could be offset by better host immunity due to improved nutrition. Here, we conduct a review and meta-analysis to show that food provisioning results in highly heterogeneous infection outcomes that depend on pathogen type and anthropogenic food source. We also find empirical support for behavioural and immune mechanisms through which human-provided resources alter host exposure and tolerance to pathogens. A review of recent theoretical models of resource provisioning and infection dynamics shows that changes in host contact rates and immunity produce strong non-linear responses in pathogen invasion and prevalence. By integrating results of our meta-analysis back into a theoretical framework, we find provisioning amplifies pathogen invasion under increased host aggregation and tolerance, but reduces transmission if provisioned food decreases dietary exposure to parasites. These results carry implications for wildlife disease management and highlight areas for future work, such as how resource shifts might affect virulence evolution.},

To explore the local ecology of Leptospira spp. in a city experiencing rapid urbanization, we assessed Leptospira prevalence in rodents from three locations in Malaysian Borneo with differing levels of anthropogenic influence: 1) high but stable influence (urban); 2) moderate yet increasing (developing); and 3) low (rural). A total of 116 urban, 122 developing and 78 rural rodents were sampled, with the majority of individuals assigned to either the Rattus rattus lineage R3 (n = 165) or Sundamys muelleri (n = 100). Leptospira spp. DNA was detected in 31.6\% of all rodents, with more urban rodents positive (44.8\%), than developing (32.0\%) or rural rodents (28.1\%), and these differences were statistically significant. The majority of positive samples were identified by sequence comparison to belong to known human pathogens L. interrogans (n = 57) and L. borgpetersenii (n = 38). Statistical analyses revealed that both Leptospira species occurred more commonly at sites with higher anthropogenic influence, particularly those with a combination of commercial and residential activity, while L. interrogans infection was also associated with low forest cover, and L. borgpetersenii was more likely to be identified at sites without natural bodies of water. This study suggests that some features associated with urbanization may promote the circulation of Leptospira spp., resulting in a potential public health risk in cities that may be substantially underestimated.},

During the last years, the amounts of parasitological studies in this sense increased, but they are still scarce in urban environments. The main aim of this study was to investigate if the helminth communities of urban rodents are structured within host assembly (compound community) or they are a result of random events occurring at each individual host scale (infracommunity). A total of 203 rodents belonging to four species, Rattus rattus (Linnaeus), Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout), Mus musculus Linnaeus and the native Oligoryzomys flavescens (Waterhouse) and captured in different landscape units of the City of Buenos Aires (industrial-residential neighbourhoods, shantytowns and parklands) were analysed. The results showed that infracommunities could be grouped according to composition and relative abundances and that they respond to the structure of the host community. Thus, the component communities defined in this study could be identified as subsets of the compound community (rodent assemblage) and infracommunities (each host) as random samples within each one. Quantitative differences among component communities were denoted by comparing the infection levels of helminths described as central species. Therefore, infracommunities of R. norvegicus and O. flavescens were the most predictable because of the high abundance of the nematodes Heterakis spumosa Schneider, 1866 and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Travassos, 1914), and Stilestrongylus flavescens (Sutton et Durette-Desset, 1991), respectively. Several mechanisms contribute to complexity of the structure of parasite communities, where specific parasites, definitive and intermediate hosts, and environmental and anthropogenic factors all play a role in the dynamics of the compound community.},

Among others, leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases worldwide and has the similar clinical manifestation with hantavirus infection in humans. Despite the fact that both pathogens have great epidemiological significance in Europe, no epizootiological data exist for urbanized areas so far. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the occurrence and prevalence of Leptospira spp. and hantaviruses in small wild rodents living in close proximity to humans. Altogether, 338 small rodents representing five different species (Apodemus agrarius, A. flavicollis, A. sylvaticus, Microtus arvalis, and Myodes glareolus) were captured in the city of Pécs (Hungary) and screened for pathogens by different types of PCR methods (TaqMan-based real-time PCR/PCR, RT-PCR/PCR). A total of 18.3\% of the rodents were positive for Leptospira kirschneri, L. interrogans, and L. borgpetersenii. Nucleic acid of Tula hantavirus and human pathogen Dobrava-Belgrade orthohantavirus were detected in 8\% of tested specimens. Furthermore, dual infections with both Leptospira spp. and hantaviruses were shown in 2.6\% of animals, suggesting that the same rodent host can be infected with several pathogens at the same time, therefore, representing a serious threat to public health. Overall, this study provides important surveillance data on the prevalence of Leptospira spp. and hantaviruses from rodents in urbanized environment for the first time in Hungary and emphasizes the importance of further ecoepidemiological investigations.},

The interrelationship of Borrelia burgdorferi (Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt, and Brenner) (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae), the etiological agent of Lyme disease (LD), and its primary vector, blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say) (Acari: Ixodidae), is a commonly used example of the dilution effect, suggesting that an increased diversity of host species will be found in large, undisturbed forested tracts and lower diversity in fragmented forests. Given that Connecticut woodlands are mature with heavy upper canopies and generally poor habitat quality, we hypothesized there would be higher diversity of host species resulting in lower prevalence of B. burgdorferi in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus Rafinesque) (Rodentia: Cricetidae) in forested residential areas. Using camera and live small mammal trapping techniques, we determined there was a greater richness of reservoir host species, significantly higher encounters with hosts, and significantly lower B. burgdorferi host-infection in residential areas as compared to large, intact forested stands. Furthermore, we determined that the driving factor of pathogen dilution was not host species diversity, but rather overall encounter abundance with alternative hosts, regardless of habitat type. Our study challenges major concepts of the dilution effect within the Connecticut landscape and calls for new managerial actions to address the current state of our woodlands and abundance of host species in the interest of both forest and public health.},

Methodology/Principal findings We surveyed the prevalence of rodent-borne Leptospira and Bartonella, as well as potential environmental sources of human exposure to Leptospira, in 4 communities along the Inter-Oceanic Highway in Madre de Dios. During the rainy and dry seasons of 2014–2015, we captured a total of 97 rodents representing 8 genera in areas that had experienced different degrees of habitat disturbance. Primarily by using 16S metagenomic sequencing, we found that most of the rodents (78\%) tested positive for Bartonella, whereas 24\% were positive for Leptospira; however, the patterns differed across seasons and the extent of habitat disruption. A high prevalence of Bartonella was identified in animals captured across both trapping seasons (72\%–83\%) and the relative abundance was correlated with increasing level of land disturbance. Leptospira-positive animals were more than twice as prevalent during the rainy season (37\%) as during the dry season (14\%). A seasonal fluctuation across the rainy, dry, and mid seasons was also apparent in environmental samples tested for Leptospira (range, 55\%–89\% of samples testing positive), and there was a high prevalence of this bacteria across all sites that were sampled in the communities. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate the need for increased awareness of rodent-borne disease and the potential for environmental spread along the communities in areas undergoing significant land-use change.},

Two species, the local black rat Rattus rattus (Linnaeus, 1758) and the invasive brown rat Rattus norvegicus (Berkenhout, 1769) might be the suspected cause. Several studies indicated the invasion of brown rats into Pakistan presumably via port city of Karachi. In this study, we modeled geospatial distribution of rodent bites for risk assessment in the region. Bite cases reported to tertiary care lady reading hospital were monitored from January 1 to August 31, 2016. Among 1747 cases, statistically informative data (n = 1295) was used for analyses. MaxEnt algorithm was employed for geospatial modeling, taking into account various environmental variables (temperature, precipitation, humidity, and elevation) and anthropogenic factors (human population density, distance from roads, distance from water channels, and land use/land cover). MaxEnt results revealed that urban slums (84.5\%) are at highest risk followed by croplands (10.9\%) and shrublands (2.7\%). Anthropogenic factors affecting incidence of rodent bites included host density (contribution: 34.7), distance from water channels (3.2), land use/land cover (2.8), and distance from roads (2). Most of the cases occurred within a radius of 0.3 km from roads and 5 km from water channels. Rodent bite incidence is currently at its peak in Peshawar vale. Factors significantly affecting rodents’ bite activity and their distribution and dispersal include urbanization, distance from roads, and water channels. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of invasion by brown rat on bite incidence.},

	abstract = {Wild rodents are important hosts for tick larvae but co-infestations with other mites and insects are largely neglected. Small rodents were trapped at four study sites in Berlin, Germany, to quantify their ectoparasite diversity. Host-specific, spatial and temporal occurrence of ectoparasites was determined to assess their influence on direct and indirect zoonotic risk due to mice and voles in an urban agglomeration. Rodent-associated arthropods were diverse, including 63 species observed on six host species with an overall prevalence of 99\%. The tick Ixodes ricinus was the most prevalent species, found on 56\% of the rodents. The trapping location clearly affected the presence of different rodent species and, therefore, the occurrence of particular host-specific parasites. In Berlin, fewer temporary and periodic parasite species as well as non-parasitic species (fleas, chiggers and nidicolous Gamasina) were detected than reported from rural areas. In addition, abundance of parasites with low host-specificity (ticks, fleas and chiggers) apparently decreased with increasing landscape fragmentation associated with a gradient of urbanisation. In contrast, stationary ectoparasites, closely adapted to the rodent host, such as the fur mites Myobiidae and Listrophoridae, were most abundant at the two urban sites. A direct zoonotic risk of infection for people may only be posed by Nosopsyllus fasciatus fleas, which were prevalent even in the city centre. More importantly, peridomestic rodents clearly supported the life cycle of ticks in the city as hosts for their subadult stages. In addition to trapping location, season, host species, body condition and host sex, infestation with fleas, gamasid Laelapidae mites and prostigmatic Myobiidae mites were associated with significantly altered abundance of I. ricinus larvae on mice and voles.

Small mammals play an important role as natural reservoirs of many Bartonella species, maintaining the greatest diversity of Bartonella described to date. Although Bartonella research has been conducted in Southeast Asia, no studies have been undertaken on small mammals in Singapore. Here, we report the detection and description of Bartonella in small mammals in Singapore during the period of November 2011 to May 2014. BartonellaDNA was detected in 20.8\% (22/106) of small mammal spleens with a PCR amplifying the beta subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase (rpoB) gene. Commensal species Rattus norvegicus and Rattus tanezumi had the highest prevalence, 75\% (3/4) and 34,5\% (10/29), followed by Suncus murinus 30\% (6/20), Tupaia glis 16,7\% (1/6) and Mus castaneus 13.3\% (2/15). Phylogenetic analysis of 18 rpoB gene sequences revealed five Bartonella genotypes circulating in the small mammals of Singapore. Bayesian tip-significance testing demonstrated strong structuring in the geographical signal, indicating that distribution of Bartonella species is correlated to the distribution of their hosts. Major deforestation and fragmentation in Singapore favour synanthropic species that traverse habitats and increase the possibility of spillover to incidental hosts.},

	abstract = {Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) inhabit cities worldwide and carry a number of zoonotic pathogens. Although many studies have investigated rat-level risk factors, there is limited research on the effects of weather and environment on zoonotic pathogen transmission ecology in rats. The objective of this study was to use a disease ecology approach to understand how abiotic (weather and urban microenvironmental features) and biotic (relative rat population abundance) factors affect Bartonella tribocorum prevalence in urban Norway rats from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. This potentially zoonotic pathogen is primarily transmitted by fleas and is common among rodents, including rats, around the world. During a systematic rat trap and removal study, city blocks were evaluated for 48 environmental variables related to waste, land/alley use and property condition, and rat abundance. We constructed 32 weather (temperature and precipitation) variables with time lags prior to the date we captured each rat. We fitted multivariable logistic regression models with rat pathogen status as the outcome. The odds of a rat testing positive for B. tribocorum were significantly lower for rats in city blocks with one or more low-rise apartment buildings compared to blocks with none (OR = 0.20; 95\% CI: 0.04–0.80; p = .02). The reason for this association may be related to unmeasured factors that influence pathogen transmission and maintenance, as well as flea vector survival. Bartonella tribocorum infection in rats was positively associated with high minimum temperatures for several time periods prior to rat capture. This finding suggests that a baseline minimum temperature may be necessary for flea vector survival and B. tribocorum transmission among rats. There was no significant association with rat abundance, suggesting a lack of density-dependent pathogen transmission. This study is an important first step to understanding how environment and weather impacts rat infections including zoonotic pathogen ecology in urban ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Despite the great efforts by health authorities in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) continues to be a major public health problem in the country. Many risk factors make KSA prone to outbreaks and epidemics; among these, rapid urbanization and the huge population movement are the most important. The disease is endemic in many parts of KSA, with the majority of cases concentrated in six regions, including Al-Qaseem, Riyadh, Al-Hassa, Aseer, Ha'il, and Al-Madinah. Leishmania major (L. major) and Leishmania tropica (L. tropica) are the main dermotropic species, and Phlebotomus papatasi (vector of L. major) and Phlebotomus sergenti (vector of L. tropica) are the proved vectors of the disease. Psammomys obesus and Meriones libycus have been defined as the principal reservoir hosts of zoonotic CL in Al-Hassa oasis, Al-Madinah, and Al-Qaseem provinces. Clinically, males are affected more than females, and there is no variation between the Saudis and expatriates in terms of number of reported cases, but the disease tends to run a more severe course among non-Saudis. Face is the most commonly affected site, and ulcerative pattern accounts for 90\% of lesions. Despite local and international recommendations of using laboratory diagnostics to confirm CL cases, most cases in KSA are diagnosed and treated on clinical grounds and local epidemiology. However, systemic parenteral sodium stibogluconate (SSG) is the first line of therapy and used to treat all CL patients irrespective of their clinical presentation or the incriminated species. In brief, more efforts are needed to combat this disease. Several aspects of the disease require more evaluation through encouragement of national and regional studies. Development of evidence based national diagnostic and management guidelines, as well as algorithms, is urgently needed to improve the practice of diagnosing and treating CL in KSA.},

Though transmission risk is a growing concern, relatively little is known about pathogens carried by urban rats.

We detected human pathogenic Bartonella species in both NYC and New Orleans rodents. We found that Norway rats in New Orleans harbored a more diverse assemblage of Bartonella than Norway rats in NYC and that Norway rats harbored a more diverse and distinct assemblage of Bartonella compared to roof rats in New Orleans. Additionally, Norway rats were more likely to be infected with Bartonella than roof rats in New Orleans. Flea infestation appears to be an important predictor of Bartonella infection in Norway rats across both cities. These findings illustrate that pathogen infections can be heterogeneous in urban rodents and indicate that further study of host species interactions could clarify variation in spillover risk across cities.},

	abstract = {The Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) is a key pest species globally and responsible for seasonal outbreaks of the zoonotic bacterial disease leptospirosis in the tropics. The city of Salvador, Brazil, has seen recent and dramatic increases in human population residing in slums, where conditions foster high rat density and increasing leptospirosis infection rates. Intervention campaigns have been used to drastically reduce rat numbers. In planning these interventions, it is important to define the eradication units - the spatial scale at which rats constitute continuous populations and from where rats are likely recolonizing, post-intervention. To provide this information, we applied spatial genetic analyses to 706 rats collected across Salvador and genotyped at 16 microsatellite loci. We performed spatially explicit analyses and estimated migration levels to identify distinct genetic units and landscape features associated with genetic divergence at different spatial scales, ranging from valleys within a slum community to city-wide analyses. Clear genetic breaks exist between rats not only across Salvador but also between valleys of slums separated by {\textless}100 m—well within the dispersal capacity of rats. The genetic data indicate that valleys may be considered separate units and identified high-traffic roads as strong impediments to rat movement. Migration data suggest that most (71–90\%) movement is contained within valleys, with no clear source population contributing to migrant rats. We use these data to recommend eradication units and discuss the importance of carrying out individual-based analyses at different spatial scales in urban landscapes.},

	abstract = {Understanding the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on zoonotic disease risk is both a critical conservation objective and a public health priority. Here, we evaluate the effects of multiple forms of anthropogenic disturbance across a precipitation gradient on the abundance of pathogen-infected small mammal hosts in a multi-host, multi-pathogen system in central Kenya. Our results suggest that conversion to cropland and wildlife loss alone drive systematic increases in rodent-borne pathogen prevalence, but that pastoral conversion has no such systematic effects. The effects are most likely explained both by changes in total small mammal abundance, and by changes in relative abundance of a few high-competence species, although changes in vector assemblages may also be involved. Several pathogens responded to interactions between disturbance type and climatic conditions, suggesting the potential for synergistic effects of anthropogenic disturbance and climate change on the distribution of disease risk. Overall, these results indicate that conservation can be an effective tool for reducing abundance of rodent-borne pathogens in some contexts (e.g. wildlife loss alone); however, given the strong variation in effects across disturbance types, pathogen taxa and environmental conditions, the use of conservation as public health interventions will need to be carefully tailored to specific pathogens and human contexts.This article is part of the themed issue ‘Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications’.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate factors such as season, landscape unit, rat sex and rat body length, affecting the abundance of the cestode Hymenolepis diminuta, a parasite of synanthropic rats, within an urban environment. A parasitological survey was undertaken on 169 rats from landscape units such as shantytowns, parklands, industrial–residential areas and scrap-metal yards in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The overall prevalence of H. diminuta was 21.3\%, although the occurrence of this species in rats was not homogeneous. The abundance of H. diminuta, using a zero-inflated negative binomial model, was correlated with rat body length. In shantytowns, abundance levels were higher than other landscape units, largely due to differences in individual environmental characteristics and rat assemblages. The populations of arthropod intermediate hosts could be subjected to seasonal fluctuations and the degree of urbanization. Shantytowns are overcrowded urban marginal settlements with most inhabitants living in precarious conditions and supporting large populations of rats, thereby increasing the risk of zoonotic infection.},

	abstract = {We detail a five-stage protocol to address physical barriers and experimental limitations that have hindered routine pathogen monitoring of wild rats in urban settings. New York City potentially harbors from 2 to 32 million rats among its 8-million people. However, at a time, when people are most vulnerable to disease from over-crowdedness brought on by increased urbanization of society, the difficulty of studying wild rats has led to a paucity of ecological and epidemiological research. Challenges of safely handling animals and the difficulties of identifying individual animals and the emergence of their respective pathogen loads (timing of infection) have impeded progress. We previously reported a method using radio frequency identification paired with load cell and camera traps to enable the identification of individual animals and subsequent monitoring of the animals’ weights (an indicator of health). However, efficient pathogen surveillance requires repeated captures of the same individual in order to isolate and document the emergence of new pathogens, or variations in pathogen load, over time. Most of these barriers are now addressed in our protocol, which is aided by the use of a mobile, outdoor laboratory, followed by incorporation of pheromone-based lures to attract individuals back to active sensors, within a camera trap. This approach allows for the assessment of individual animal health, behaviors under camera, and changing pathogen loads and weights in most urban environments (e.g., financial district, docks, sewers, and residential). Five phases are described and presented: (1) site selection and urban trapping, (2) anesthetization, (3) serological and ectoparasite collection, (4) microchip implantation, and (5) retrapping and luring animals back to active remote sensors. In order to fulfill the unmet call for preemptive pathogen surveillance, public health officials and researchers may wish to adapt, or modify, similar protocols to ensure early detection and monitoring of rat-borne zoonoses, before they become problematic.},

	abstract = {Native to China and Mongolia, the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) now enjoys a worldwide distribution. While black rats and the house mouse tracked the regional development of human agricultural settlements, brown rats did not appear in Europe until the 1500s, suggesting their range expansion was a response to relatively recent increases in global trade. We inferred the global phylogeography of brown rats using 32 k SNPs, and detected 13 evolutionary clusters within five expansion routes. One cluster arose following a southward expansion into Southeast Asia. Three additional clusters arose from two independent eastward expansions: one expansion from Russia to the Aleutian Archipelago, and a second to western North America. Westward expansion resulted in the colonization of Europe from which subsequent rapid colonization of Africa, the Americas and Australasia occurred, and multiple evolutionary clusters were detected. An astonishing degree of fine-grained clustering between and within sampling sites underscored the extent to which urban heterogeneity shaped genetic structure of commensal rodents. Surprisingly, few individuals were recent migrants, suggesting that recruitment into established populations is limited. Understanding the global population structure of R. norvegicus offers novel perspectives on the forces driving the spread of zoonotic disease, and aids in development of rat eradication programmes.},

This study performed a diagnosis of species occurrence of their hosts (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and vectors (Amblyomma sculptum and Amblyomma dubitatum) on the warning area for this reemerging disease in Brazil.

Materials and Methods:
The study was conducted in a warning area for BSF in the city of Americana, São Paulo state. The occurrence of capybaras was registered by use of binoculars and GPS equipment and 24 acarological researches were performed through 180 CO2 traps. Samples of adult ticks were dissected for salivary glands removal, DNA extraction, and evaluation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) being tested by initial gltA-PCR, ompA-PCR, and Rickettsia bellii-specific PCR, with the positive samples subjected to sequencing.

Results:
Eleven clusters of capybaras (total of 71 individuals), were observed along the riparian of Ribeirão Quilombo and 7,114 specimens of A. sculptum and 7,198 specimens of A. dubitatum were collected in this same area. About 568 samples of adult ticks were dissected for salivary glands removal, DNA extraction and evaluation by gltA-PCR, with results of 1.94\% (11/568) of positive samples. Results for the initial gltA-PCR indicated none positive sample to Rickettsia species into A. sculptum and 11 positive samples to A. dubitatum. These samples were negative to the ompA-PCR and positive to the Rickettsia bellii-specific PCR protocol and subjected to DNA sequencing, whose result indicated 100\% similarity to Rickettsia bellii. The distribution of tick species A. sculptum and A. dubitatum was configured regarding to the biotic potential of the riparian areas, measuring the risks for BSF in peri-urban areas of Americana.

Conclusion:
These results confirmed a status of epidemiological warning with a strong association of the amplifiers hosts of Rickettsia and tick vectors for the transmission of BSF to humans in this region.},

	abstract = {Leptospirosis essentially affects human following contact with rodent urine-contaminated water. As such, it was mainly found associated with rice culture, recreational activities and flooding. This is also the reason why it has mainly been investigated in temperate as well as warm and humid regions, while arid zones have been only very occasionally monitored for this disease. In particular, data for West African countries are extremely scarce. Here, we took advantage of an extensive survey of urban rodents in Niamey, Niger, in order to look for rodent-borne pathogenic Leptospira species presence and distribution across the city. To do so, we used high throughput bacterial 16S-based metabarcoding, lipL32 gene-targeting RT-PCR, rrs gene sequencing and VNTR typing as well as GIS-based multivariate spatial analysis. Our results show that leptospires seem absent from the core city where usual Leptospira reservoir rodent species (namely R. rattus and M. natalensis) are yet abundant. On the contrary, L. kirschneri was detected in Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus, two rodent species that are restricted to irrigated cultures within the city. Moreover, the VNTR profiles showed that rodent-borne leptospires in Niamey belong to previously undescribed serovars. Altogether, our study points towards the importance of market gardening in maintain and circulation of leptospirosis within Sahelian cities. In Africa, irrigated urban agriculture constitutes a pivotal source of food supply, especially in the context of the ongoing extensive urbanization of the continent. With this in mind, we speculate that leptospirosis may represent a zoonotic disease of concern also in arid regions that would deserve to be more rigorously surveyed, especially in urban agricultural settings., We surveyed rodent-borne Leptospira in rodents from Niamey, the capital town of Niger, using bacterial metabarcoding, RT-PCR, sequencing, VNTR typing and GIS-based geostatistics. Two new serovars of Leptospira kirschneri were identified in Arvicanthis niloticus and Cricetomys gambianus, two species that inhabit exclusively urban irrigated gardens. Since no rodent-borne leptospires could be found in the core city, our results point towards the importance of urban agriculture in the maintaining and the circulation of these bacteria in cities from semi-arid regions where they are usually poorly documented and even hardly looked for. Accordingly, this is one of the very rare mentions of these zoonotic agents in Sahel, and the first one in Niger. Keeping in mind the critical role of urban gardening for food security in extensively growing West African cities, we believe that leptospirosis should be more closely scrutinized in Sahelian countries where numerous cases of human fevers are of unknown origin.},

The spatial distribution patterns observed for each rodent species were then used to assess how changes in habitat structure may potentially affect the risk of several major rodent-borne diseases. For this analysis, we used an extensive geo-referenced data base containing details of rodents trapped from seven sites in Thailand, Cambodia and Lao PDR. We also developed land-cover layers for each site. Results from published studies that screened for five major rodent-borne pathogens in rodents were used to estimate how these pathogens would likely be impacted by these alterations in habitat structure and composition. Our results confirmed the specialist and/or synanthropic status of several rodent species, although the majority of species studied demonstrated some degree of low level of habitat specialization. Habitat diversity and its alteration (decreasing forest cover, increasing fragmentation, increasing urbanization) were found to favour the presence of synanthropic rodent species such as Rattus tanezumi, known to damage crops and host important rodent-borne diseases. Synthesis and applications. The five major rodent-borne pathogens were linked to ongoing changes in habitat structure. In particular, the presence of Bartonella spp. and hantaviruses seemed to be favoured in wooded landscapes affected by ongoing fragmentation and human encroachments. Rodents also pose significant problems for crop production in South-East Asia. Our results showed that the structure of the landscape affects the likely presence of rodent species considered as agricultural pests. The patchy structure of a landscape can either enhance, such as B. indica, or decrease, such as B. savilei, the presence of rodents that may cause serious damage to crops.},

	abstract = {Rodent-borne hantaviruses are a group of zoonotic agents that cause hemorrhagic fever in humans. The transmission of hantaviruses among rodent hosts may be higher with the increase of reservoir host abundance in a given area (density-dependent transmission) and with the decrease of small mammal diversity (dilution effect phenomenon). These population and community parameters may be modified by habitat fragmentation; however, studies that focus on fragmentation and its effect on hantavirus infection risk are scarce. To further understanding of this issue, we assessed some population and community responses of rodents that may increase the risk for hantavirus transmission among wildlife hosts in the Americas. We conducted a meta-analysis of published studies to assess the responses of small mammals to fragmentation of native habitats, relative to patch size. Our analyses included five countries and 14 case studies for abundance of reservoir hosts (8 species) and 15 case studies for species richness. We found that a reduction of patch area due to habitat fragmentation is associated with increased reservoir host abundances and decreased small mammal richness, which is mainly due to the loss of non-host small mammals. According to these results, habitat fragmentation in the Americas should be considered as an epidemiological risk factor for hantavirus transmission to humans. These findings are important to assess potential risk of infection when fragmentation of native habitats occurs.},

Baylisascaris procyonis , a parasitic roundworm with the ability to cause fatal central nervous system disease in many mammals, including humans, is a zoonotic threat, and research suggests that parasite recruitment rates by intermediate hosts are highly variable among forest patches in fragmented landscapes. During 2008, we sampled 353 white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) from 22 forest patches distributed throughout a fragmented agricultural ecosystem to determine the influence of landscape-level habitat attributes on infection rates of B. procyonis in mice. We characterized each mouse in terms of infection status and intensity of infection, and calculated (on a patch-wide basis) prevalence, mean abundance of B. procyonis , and mean intensity of infection. We used an information-theoretic approach to develop a suite of candidate models characterizing the influence of landscape attributes on each of our measured characteristics of B. procyonis infection in white-footed mice, based on previous knowledge of raccoon ( Procyon lotor ) ecology and B. procyonis distribution in agricultural ecosystems. We observed evidence of B. procyonis infection in mice across all 22 habitat patches sampled. However, parasite recruitment rates and intensity were highly variable among patches, and the results of our analyses suggest that spatial variability in B. procyonis infections was primarily driven by emergent properties of fragmented ecosystems. In particular, prevalence, abundance, and intensity of B. procyonis infections in mice were negatively associated with the size and connectivity of forest patches. These results support previous studies indicating that habitat fragmentation can alter the transmission dynamics of infectious disease, and suggest that factors below the scale of landscape, i.e., fine-scale habitat structure or demographic and behavioral attributes of intermediate and/or definitive hosts, also may be important for predicting patterns of B. procyonis infection in intermediate hosts.},

Around 600 cases are diagnosed per year in France. Half of these cases occur in French overseas territories, where the incidence can be more than 100 times higher than in mainland France. Leptospirosis has been under-diagnosed because of non-specific symptoms, inadequate surveillance system, and lack of readily available quick and simple diagnostic tests. Most cases of leptospirosis are currently detected by PCR amplification of bacterial DNA from the blood during the first week after the onset of symptoms, or by detection of antibodies during the second week of the disease. More than 300 serovars have been identified among leptospires, including serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae, the most frequent in human infections. Leptospirosis remains a major public health issue in many developing countries, one century after discovering the causative agent. Leptospirosis is expected to become more important due to a rapid urbanization in developing countries (slums), global warming, and extreme climatic events (floods).
Résumé
La leptospirose est une zoonose de répartition mondiale dont le rat constitue le principal réservoir. La leptospirose est généralement liée aux contacts avec l’eau douce ou les animaux. En France, quelques 600 cas annuels sont diagnostiqués, dont la moitié provient des départements et territoires d’Outre-Mer où l’incidence peut être 100 fois plus élevée qu’en Métropole. La leptospirose reste cependant sous-estimée du fait de l’absence de symptômes spécifiques, d’un système de surveillance défaillant et d’un manque de tests de diagnostic rapides et simples à réaliser. Le diagnostic s’effectue principalement par la détection de l’ADN bactérien dans le sang par PCR lors de la première semaine de la maladie ou par la recherche des anticorps à partir de la deuxième semaine. Plus de 300 sérovars sont retrouvés chez les leptospires, parmi lesquels le sérovar Icterohaemorrhagiae est l’un des plus fréquemment rencontrés en clinique humaine. Près d’un siècle après la découverte de l’agent causal de la leptospirose, cette zoonose reste un problème de santé publique majeur dans de nombreux pays en voie de développement, notamment à cause de l’urbanisation grandissante (bidonvilles), le réchauffement climatique et l’apparition plus fréquente de phénomènes climatiques extrêmes (inondations).},

Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) are a widely distributed rodent throughout most of South America, but are restricted to areas of standing water. As the Gran Chaco ecosystem of Paraguay is converted from dry tropical forest to pastureland, we hypothesize that this alteration creates potential for invasion by capybara into newly fragmented areas. We surveyed throughout the Chaco to estimate the distribution of capybara, and we collected noninvasive genetic samples. We used ecological niche modeling based on six environmental or climatic variables, and we modeled both the current distribution of capybara and the distribution of capybara 80 years ago. We then verified the hypothesized demographic signal generated with our model using phylogeographic analyses of 386 bp of the mtDNA control region. Comparison of present and past models suggested that populations expanded into the Gran Chaco after forest was converted to pastureland. Analyses of the mitochondrial D-loop supported the rapid range expansion scenario. We also found evidence of secondary contact of two distinct phylogroups which had previously been disjunct. Anthropogenic land transformation appeared to be a major factor influencing the distribution, as predicted by the niche model and confirmed by genetic data. Habitat modification altered connectivity of populations across the landscape. In addition, long separated clades of capybara are now admixed throughout the Paraguayan Chaco. The invasion of a large bodied herbivore into the High Chaco region may exacerbate the degradation of forest and prevent forest regeneration. As the reservoir host of several zoonotic diseases, the expansion and contact of two previously disjunct capybara populations has implications for disease emergence.},

Wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are common in highly urbanized areas but surprisingly little is known of their population structure. We sampled individuals from 11 locations within Baltimore, Maryland, to characterize the genetic structure and extent of gene flow between areas within the city. Clustering methods and a neighbour-joining tree based on pairwise genetic distances supported an east-west division in the inner city, and a third cluster comprised of historically more recent sites. Most individuals (approximately 95\%) were assigned to their area of capture, indicating strong site fidelity. Moreover, the axial dispersal distance of rats (62 m) fell within typical alley length. Several rats were assigned to areas 2-11.5 km away, indicating some, albeit infrequent, long-distance movement within the city. Although individual movement appears to be limited (30-150 m), locations up to 1.7 km are comprised of relatives. Moderate F(ST), differentiation between identified clusters, and high allelic diversity indicate that regular gene flow, either via recruitment or migration, has prevented isolation. Therefore, ecology of commensal rodents in urban areas and life-history characteristics of Norway rats likely counteract many expected effects of isolation or founder events. An understanding of levels of connectivity of rat populations inhabiting urban areas provides information about the spatial scale at which populations of rats may spread disease, invade new areas, or be eradicated from an existing area without reinvasion.},

Flooding from the watershed in 2004 led to an outbreak of leptospirosis among people exposed to ﬂood waters during clean-up efforts. We present hydrologic analysis of a ﬂood-producing storm and animal sampling results to illustrate the hypothesis that watershed development may increase the likelihood of ﬂooding and the magnitude of sources of pathogenic microbes that could be mobilized during ﬂood-producing rainfall. The analysis considers land-use changes in the Manoa stream watershed that took place between 1939 and 2005.},

We used satellite imagery to produce several spatial variables that described landscape; however, only slope was consistently related to abundances of the two most dominant rodent species. Using regression, we constructed a spatial model of areas of Z. brevicauda dominance, which in turn relates to higher infection rates. The model predicts highest abundances of Z. brevicauda in flat areas, where humans also dominate.

	abstract = {Re-emergence of human cases of plague after decades of silence does not necessarily mean that plague foci are re-emerging. Most often, Yersinia pestis bacteria have been maintained and circulating at low levels in the rodent populations. It seems therefore more appropriate to speak in terms of expansion or regression phases for sylvatic rodent plague foci and to reserve the term re-emergence for human cases. From the analysis of well-documented human plague cases in Madagascar, we underline the causes of re-emergence that can be generalized to most world foci, and can help define environments at risk where the threat of new emergence lurks. In all recent plague outbreaks, usually more than one risk factor was at the origin of the re-emergence. The reduction or discontinuance of surveillance and control, as well as poverty and insalubrity are the main factors in the re-emergence of human cases, allowing increased contacts with infected rodents and fleas. Environment changes (i.e. climatic changes, deforestation, urbanization) induce changes in flea and rodent populations by (i) extension of rodent habitats (for example by replacing forests by steppes or farmlands); (ii) modifications in population dynamics (possible outbreaks due to an increase of available food resources); but also, (iii) emergence of new vectors, reservoirs and new Y. pestis genotypes. Numerous and spontaneous genomic rearrangements occur at high frequencies in Y. pestis, which may confer selective advantages, enhancing the ability of Y. pestis to survive, to be transmitted to new hosts, and to colonize new environments. Therefore, any environmental change should be taken as a warning signal and active surveillance programs should be initiated.},

The current review analyses and compares epidemiological and ecological results obtained in both regions. Analysis of rodent species assemblages within quantified rural landscapes in central China and eastern France shows a significant association between host species for the pathogenic helminth Echinococcus multilocularis, with prevalences of human alveolar echinococcosis and with land area under shrubland or grassland. This suggests that at the regional scale landscape can affect human disease distribution through interaction with small mammal communities and their population dynamics. Lidicker's ROMPA hypothesis helps to explain this association and provides a novel explanation of how landscape changes may result in increased risk of a rodent-borne zoonotic disease.},

	abstract = {Diverse host communities commonly inhibit the spread of parasites at small scales. However, the generality of this effect remains controversial. Here, we present the analysis of 205 biodiversity–disease relationships on 67 parasite species to test whether biodiversity–disease relationships are generally nonlinear, moderated by spatial scale, and sensitive to underrepresentation in the literature. Our analysis of the published literature reveals that biodiversity–disease relationships are generally hump-shaped (i.e., nonlinear) and biodiversity generally inhibits disease at local scales, but this effect weakens as spatial scale increases. Spatial scale is, however, related to study design and parasite type, highlighting the need for additional multiscale research. Few studies are unrepresentative of communities at low diversity, but missing data at low diversity from field studies could result in underreporting of amplification effects. Experiments appear to underrepresent high-diversity communities, which could result in underreporting of dilution effects. Despite context dependence, biodiversity loss at local scales appears to increase disease, suggesting that at local scales, biodiversity loss could negatively impact human and wildlife populations.},

Here, we present the first characterization of terrestrial biomes based on global patterns of sustained, direct human interaction with ecosystems. Eighteen “anthropogenic biomes” were identified through empirical analysis of global population, land use, and land cover. More than 75\% of Earth's ice-free land showed evidence of alteration as a result of human residence and land use, with less than a quarter remaining as wildlands, supporting just 11\% of terrestrial net primary production. Anthropogenic biomes offer a new way forward by acknowledging human influence on global ecosystems and moving us toward models and investigations of the terrestrial biosphere that integrate human and ecological systems.},

This may be due to the fact that ecological change and disease emergence are often mediated through complex and large-scale processes that are not amenable to traditional reductionist approaches to causal inference. Here, we suggest strategies assembled from diverse disciplines, including ecology, epidemiology, and the social sciences, to analyze complex relationships, promote cooperation, increase efficiency, and minimize bias when investigating the ecological drivers of disease emergence. These techniques, which complement traditional hypothesis testing, include epidemiologic causal criteria, strong inference, causal diagrams, model selection, and triangulation. We also present several examples from recent emerging infectious disease investigations, including Hendra virus, Nipah virus, coral diseases, and avian influenza, where these techniques were successfully applied. Here, we outline some of the barriers to advancing our understanding of causation in disease ecology and offer some solutions for investigating large-scale ecological drivers, such as global warming, pollution, and land-use change.},

	abstract = {Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are recognized as the major etiologic agents of the common cold. Starting from the observation that local hyperthermic treatment is beneficial in patients with natural and experimental common colds, we have studied the effect of brief hyperthermic treatment (HT) on HRV replication in HeLa cells. We report that a 20-min HT at 45°C is effective in suppressing HRV multiplication by more than 90\% when applied at specific stages of the virus replication cycle. Synthesis of virus proteins is not affected by HT, indicating that the target for treatment is a posttranslational event. The antiviral effect is a transient cell-mediated event and is associated with the synthesis of the 70-kDa heat shock protein hsp70. Unlike poliovirus, rhinovirus infection does not inhibit the expression of hsp70 induced by heat. The possibility that hsp70 could play a role in the control of rhinovirus replication is suggested by the fact that a different class of HSP inducers, the cyclopentenone prostaglandins PGA1 and Δ12-PGJ2, were also effective in inhibiting HRV replication in HeLa cells. Inhibition of hsp70 expression by actinomycin D prevented the antiviral activity of prostaglandins in HRV-infected cells. These results indicate that the beneficial effect of respiratory hyperthermia may be mediated by the induction of a cytoprotective heat shock response in rhinovirus-infected cells.},

A renewed interest in coronaviral research has led to the discovery of several novel human CoVs and since then much progress has been made in understanding the CoV life cycle. The CoV envelope (E) protein is a small, integral membrane protein involved in several aspects of the virus’ life cycle, such as assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis. Recent studies have expanded on its structural motifs and topology, its functions as an ion-channelling viroporin, and its interactions with both other CoV proteins and host cell proteins.},

Design Living rapid review of observational and experimental studies with random-effects hierarchical Bayesian meta-analyses. Published articles and pre-prints were identified via MEDLINE and medRxiv. Setting Community or hospital. No restrictions on location. Participants Adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 test or a COVID-19 diagnosis. Measurements Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation, disease severity and mortality stratified by smoking status. Study quality was assessed (i.e. ‘good’, ‘fair’ and ‘poor’). Findings Version 7 (searches up to 25 August 2020) included 233 studies with 32 ‘good’ and ‘fair’ quality studies included in meta-analyses. Fifty-seven studies (24.5\%) reported current, former and never smoking status. Recorded smoking prevalence among people with COVID-19 was generally lower than national prevalence. Current compared with never smokers were at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR=0.74, 95\% Credible Interval (CrI) = 0.58-0.93, τ = 0.41). Data for former smokers were inconclusive (RR=1.05, 95\% CrI = 0.95-1.17, τ = 0.17) but favoured there being no important association (21\% probability of RR ≥1.1). Former compared with never smokers were at somewhat increased risk of hospitalisation (RR=1.20, CrI = 1.03-1.44, τ = 0.17), greater disease severity (RR=1.52, CrI = 1.13-2.07, τ = 0.29), and mortality (RR=1.39, 95\% CrI = 1.09-1.87, τ = 0.27). Data for current smokers were inconclusive (RR=1.06, CrI = 0.82-1.35, τ = 0.27; RR=1.25, CrI = 0.85-1.93, τ = 0.34; RR=1.22, 95\% CrI = 0.78-1.94, τ = 0.49 respectively) but favoured there being no important associations with hospitalisation and mortality (35\% and 70\% probability of RR ≥1.1, respectively) and a small but important association with disease severity (79\% probability of RR ≥1.1). Conclusions Compared with never smokers, current smokers appear to be at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection while former smokers appear to be at increased risk of hospitalisation, increased disease severity and mortality from COVID-19. However, it is uncertain whether these associations are causal.},

	abstract = {Background: Hospital admission provides a special opportunity to identify smokers, and treatment of smoking in hospitalised patients is particularly effective.
Objectives: We hypothesised that smoking prevalence is higher in people admitted to hospital compared to the general UK population, and higher in specific subgroups, such as emergency admissions.
Methods: A British Thoracic Society online survey was used by hospitals, who randomly selected elective and emergency admissions under surgery and medicine, and retrospectively reviewed their case notes. Documentation of smoking status and treatment was recorded.
Results: 146 institutions participated with 14,750 patient records submitted. Smoking status was recorded in 73\% of cases. Smoking prevalence in UK hospital admissions was 25\% (28\% in males; 23\% in females), significantly higher than the national average of 19\% in Great Britain1 (p{\textless}0.0001). The prevalence was highest in patients under 45 years of age (42\%). Smoking prevalence in emergency admissions (27\%) was higher than in elective admissions (19\%). Smoking prevalence was also higher in respiratory patients (30\%) than in other medical and surgical specialties. Of 2716 smokers only 28\% were offered treatment, and under 6\% received hospital based treatment for tobacco dependence.
Conclusions: This is the first UK wide study to measure real time smoking prevalence in hospitals. Smoking prevalence is significantly higher in people admitted to hospital than the general UK population. It is especially high in younger adults and emergency admissions. With at least 1 in 4 patients being current smokers, hospitalisation represents a unique opportunity to treat tobacco addiction.

	abstract = {Introduction
COVID-19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation and diffuse intravascular coagulation. Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available.
Methods
We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital.
Results
We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13\%), 22 were discharged alive (12\%) and 139 (76\%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31\% (95\%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27\% (95\%CI 17-37\%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7\% (95\%CI 0-8.2\%). PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81\%). Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05/per year, 95\%CI 1.004-1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time {\textgreater} 3 s or activated partial thromboplastin time {\textgreater} 5 s (aHR 4.1, 95\%CI 1.9-9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications.
Conclusion
The 31\% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is remarkably high. Our findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, and are strongly suggestive of increasing the prophylaxis towards high-prophylactic doses, even in the absence of randomized evidence.},

	abstract = {Urbanization reduces exposure risk to many wildlife parasites and in general, improves overall health. However, our study importantly shows the complicated relationship between the diffusion of zoonotic pathogens and urbanization. Here, we reveal an unexpected relationship between hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome incidence caused by a severe rodent-borne zoonotic pathogen worldwide and the process of urbanization in developing China. Our findings show that the number of urban immigrants is highly correlated with human incidence over time and also explain how the endemic turning points are associated with economic growth during the urbanization process. Our study shows that urbanizing regions of the developing world should focus their attention on zoonotic diseases., Urbanization and rural–urban migration are two factors driving global patterns of disease and mortality. There is significant concern about their potential impact on disease burden and the effectiveness of current control approaches. Few attempts have been made to increase our understanding of the relationship between urbanization and disease dynamics, although it is generally believed that urban living has contributed to reductions in communicable disease burden in industrialized countries. To investigate this relationship, we carried out spatiotemporal analyses using a 48-year-long dataset of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome incidence (HFRS; mainly caused by two serotypes of hantavirus in China: Hantaan virus and Seoul virus) and population movements in an important endemic area of south China during the period 1963–2010. Our findings indicate that epidemics coincide with urbanization, geographic expansion, and migrant movement over time. We found a biphasic inverted U-shaped relationship between HFRS incidence and urbanization, with various endemic turning points associated with economic growth rates in cities. Our results revealed the interrelatedness of urbanization, migration, and hantavirus epidemiology, potentially explaining why urbanizing cities with high economic growth exhibit extended epidemics. Our results also highlight contrasting effects of urbanization on zoonotic disease outbreaks during periods of economic development in China.},

We perform safety testing to demonstrate the efficacy of our HUDSON protocol in heat-inactivating VHF viruses before SHERLOCK testing, eliminating the need for an extraction. We develop a user-friendly protocol and mobile application (HandLens) to report results, facilitating SHERLOCK’s use in endemic regions.

Rodents are known as natural reservoirs of the causative Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) while humans are regarded as incidental, spill-over hosts. Analysis of genetic sequences continues to add to our understanding of the evolutionary history, emergence patterns, and the epidemiology of LASV. Hitherto, the source of data in such investigations has mainly comprised human clinical samples. Presently, a rise in the quantity of virus strains accessed through ecological studies over the last 15 years now allows us to explore how LASV sequences obtained from rodents might affect phylogenetic patterns. In this study, we phylogenetically compared LASV sequences obtained from both rodents and humans across West Africa, including those from two localities highly endemic for the disease: Ekpoma in Nigeria and Kenema in Sierra Leone. We performed a time-calibrated phylogeny, using a Bayesian analysis on 198 taxa, including 102 sequences from rodents and 96 from humans. Contrary to expectation, our results show that LASV strains detected in humans within these localities, even those sampled recently, are consistently ancient to those circulating in rodents in the same area. We discuss the possibilities connected to this preliminary outcome. We also propose modalities to guide more comprehensive comparisons of human and rodent data in LASV molecular epidemiological studies.},

Diagnosis of LASV infection is challenged by the genetic diversity of the virus, which is greatest in Nigeria. The ReLASV Pan-Lassa Antigen Rapid Test (Pan-Lassa RDT) is a point-of-care, in vitro diagnostic test that utilizes a mixture of polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant nucleoproteins of representative strains from the three most prevalent LASV lineages (II, III and IV). We compared the performance of the Pan-LASV RDT to available quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays during the 2018 LF outbreak in Nigeria. For patients with acute LF (RDT positive, IgG/IgM negative) during initial screening, RDT performance was 83.3\% sensitivity and 92.8\% specificity when compared to composite results of two qPCR assays. 100\% of samples that gave Ct values below 22 on both qPCR assays were positive on the Pan-Lassa RDT. There were significantly elevated case fatality rates and elevated liver transaminase levels in subjects whose samples were RDT positive compared to RDT negative.},

In liquids, Lassa virus was found to decay more quickly at 30 \&deg;C compared to room temperature. Sealed samples protected from environmental desiccation were more stable than samples open to the environment. In a small particle aerosol, the decay rate of Lassa virus was determined at 2.69\% per minute.

	abstract = {Lassa fever is a rodent-borne disease caused by Lassa virus (LASV). It causes fever, dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, coughing, diarrhea, internal bleeding and facial edema. The disease has been known in Guinea since 1960 but only anectodical acute cases have been reported to date. In January 2019, a 35-year-old man, a wood merchant from Kissidougou, Forest Guinea, presented himself at several health centers with persistent fever, frequent vomiting and joint pain. He was repeatedly treated for severe malaria, and died three weeks later in Mamou regional hospital. Diﬀerential diagnosis identiﬁed LASV as the cause of death. No secondary cases were reported. The complete LASV genome was obtained using next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this strain, namely the Kissidougou strain, belongs to the clade IV circulating in Guinea and Sierra Leone, and is thought to have emerged some 150 years ago. Due to the similarity of symptoms with malaria, Lassa fever is still a disease that is diﬃcult to recognize and that may remain undiagnosed in health centers in Guinea.},

Gao et al. (International Workshop on Complex Networks and their Applications, 2017) have established a method to analyze patent classes of similar technologies as network communities. In this paper, we adopt the stabilized Louvain method for network community detection to improve consistency and stability. Incorporating the overlapping community mapping algorithm, we also develop a new method to identify the central nodes based on the temporal evolution of the network structure and track the changes of communities over time. A case study of Germany’s patent data is used to demonstrate and verify the application of the method and the results. Compared to the non-network metrics and conventional network measures, we offer a heuristic approach with a dynamic view and more stable results.},

	abstract = {Although widely used in practice, the behavior and accuracy of the popular module identification technique called modularity maximization is not well understood in practical contexts. Here, we present a broad characterization of its performance in such situations. First, we revisit and clarify the resolution limit phenomenon for modularity maximization. Second, we show that the modularity function Q exhibits extreme degeneracies: it typically admits an exponential number of distinct high-scoring solutions and typically lacks a clear global maximum. Third, we derive the limiting behavior of the maximum modularity Qmax for one model of infinitely modular networks, showing that it depends strongly both on the size of the network and on the number of modules it contains. Finally, using three real-world metabolic networks as examples, we show that the degenerate solutions can fundamentally disagree on many, but not all, partition properties such as the composition of the largest modules and the distribution of module sizes. These results imply that the output of any modularity maximization procedure should be interpreted cautiously in scientific contexts. They also explain why many heuristics are often successful at finding high-scoring partitions in practice and why different heuristics can disagree on the modular structure of the same network. We conclude by discussing avenues for mitigating some of these behaviors, such as combining information from many degenerate solutions or using generative models.},

	abstract = {Supplemental food provided to wildlife by human activities can be more abundant and predictable than natural resources, and subsequent changes in wildlife ecology can have profound impacts on host–parasite interactions. Identifying traits of species associated with increases or decreases in infection outcomes with resource provisioning could improve assessments of wildlife most prone to disease risks in changing environments. We conducted a phylogenetic meta-analysis of 342 host–parasite interactions across 56 wildlife species and three broad taxonomic groups of parasites to identify host-level traits that influence whether provisioning is associated with increases or decreases in infection. We predicted dietary generalists that capitalize on novel food would show greater infection in provisioned habitats owing to population growth and food-borne exposure to contaminants and parasite infectious stages. Similarly, species with fast life histories could experience stronger demographic and immunological benefits from provisioning that affect parasite transmission. We also predicted that wide-ranging and migratory behaviours could increase infection risks with provisioning if concentrated and non-seasonal foods promote dense aggregations that increase exposure to parasites. We found that provisioning increased infection with bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa (i.e. microparasites) most for wide-ranging, dietary generalist host species. Effect sizes for ectoparasites were also highest for host species with large home ranges but were instead lowest for dietary generalists. In contrast, the type of provisioning was a stronger correlate of infection outcomes for helminths than host species traits. Our analysis highlights host traits related to movement and feeding behaviour as important determinants of whether species experience greater infection with supplemental feeding. These results could help prioritize monitoring wildlife with particular trait profiles in anthropogenic habitats to reduce infectious disease risks in provisioned populations.},

	abstract = {While the effects of deforestation and habitat fragmentation on parasite prevalence or richness are well investigated, host–parasite networks are still understudied despite their importance in understanding the mechanisms of these major disturbances. Because fragmentation may negatively impact species occupancy, abundance and co-occurrence, we predict a link between spatiotemporal changes in habitat and the architecture of host–parasite networks. For this, we used an extensive data set on 16 rodent species and 29 helminth species from seven localities of South-East Asia. We analysed the effects of rapid deforestation on connectance and modularity of helminth–parasite networks. We estimated both the degree of fragmentation and the rate of deforestation through the development of land uses and their changes through the last 20 to 30 years in order to take into account the dynamics of habitat fragmentation in our statistical analyses. We found that rapid fragmentation does not affect helminth species richness per se but impacts host–parasite interactions as the rodent–helminth network becomes less connected and more modular. Our results suggest that parasite sharing among host species may become more difficult to maintain with the increase of habitat disturbance.},

	abstract = {Humans create ecologically simplified landscapes that favour some wildlife species, but not others. Here, we explore the possibility that those species that tolerate or do well in human-modified environments, or ‘synanthropic’ species, are predominantly the hosts of zoonotic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). We do this using global wildlife conservation data and wildlife host information extracted from systematically reviewed emerging infectious disease literature. The evidence for this relationship is examined with special emphasis on the Australasian, South East Asian and East Asian regions. We find that synanthropic wildlife hosts are approximately 15 times more likely than other wildlife in this region to be the source of emerging infectious diseases, and this association is essentially independent of the taxonomy of the species. A significant positive association with EIDs is also evident for those wildlife species of low conservation risk. Since the increase and spread of native and introduced species able to adapt to human-induced landscape change is at the expense of those species most vulnerable to habitat loss, our findings suggest a mechanism linking land conversion, global decline in biodiversity and a rise in EIDs of wildlife origin.},

Previous research has shown that rat abundance is largely determined by features of the environment; however, the specific urban environmental factors that influence rat population density within cities have yet to be clearly identified. Additionally, there are no well described tools or methodologies for conducting an in-depth evaluation of the relationship between urban rat abundance and the environment. In this study, we developed a systematic environmental observation tool using methods borrowed from the field of systematic social observation. This tool, which employed a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, was then used to identify environmental factors associated with the relative abundance of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) in an inner-city neighborhood of Vancouver, Canada. Using a multivariate zero-inflated negative binomial model, we found that a variety of factors, including specific land use, building condition, and amount of refuse, were related to rat presence and abundance. Qualitative data largely supported and further clarified observed statistical relationships, but also identified conflicting and unique situations not easily captured through quantitative methods. Overall, the tool helped us to better understand the relationship between features of the urban environment and relative rat abundance within our study area and may useful for studying environmental determinants of zoonotic disease prevalence/distribution among urban rat populations in the future.},

	abstract = {Populations of large wildlife are declining on local and global scales. The impacts of this pulse of size-selective defaunation include cascading changes to smaller animals, particularly rodents, and alteration of many ecosystem processes and services, potentially involving changes to prevalence and transmission of zoonotic disease. Understanding linkages between biodiversity loss and zoonotic disease is important for both public health and nature conservation programs, and has been a source of much recent scientific debate. In the case of rodent-borne zoonoses, there is strong conceptual support, but limited empirical evidence, for the hypothesis that defaunation, the loss of large wildlife, increases zoonotic disease risk by directly or indirectly releasing controls on rodent density. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally excluding large wildlife from a savanna ecosystem in East Africa, and examining changes in prevalence and abundance of Bartonella spp. infection in rodents and their flea vectors. We found no effect of wildlife removal on per capita prevalence of Bartonella infection in either rodents or fleas. However, because rodent and, consequently, flea abundance doubled following experimental defaunation, the density of infected hosts and infected fleas was roughly twofold higher in sites where large wildlife was absent. Thus, defaunation represents an elevated risk in Bartonella transmission to humans (bartonellosis). Our results (i) provide experimental evidence of large wildlife defaunation increasing landscape-level disease prevalence, (ii) highlight the importance of susceptible host regulation pathways and host/vector density responses in biodiversity–disease relationships, and (iii) suggest that rodent-borne disease responses to large wildlife loss may represent an important context where this relationship is largely negative.},

Identifying the type and extent of vector response to habitat change will enable better and more accurate management strategies for anthropogenic disease spread. We compiled and analyzed data from published empirical studies to test for patterns among flea and small mammal diversity, abundance, several measures of flea infestation, and host specificity in 70 small mammal communities of five biomes and three levels of human disturbance: remote/wild areas, agricultural areas, and urban areas. Ten of 12 mammal and flea characteristics showed a significant effect of disturbance category (six), biome (four), or both (two). Six variables had a significant interaction effect. For mammal-flea communities in forest habitats (39 of the 70 communities), disturbance affected all 12 characteristics. Overall, flea and mammal richness were higher in remote versus urban sites. Most measures of flea infestation, including percent of infested mammals and fleas/mammal and fleas/mammal species increased with increasing disturbance or peaked at intermediate levels of disturbance. In addition, host use increased, and the number of specialist fleas decreased, as human disturbance increased. Of the three most common biomes (forest, grassland/savanna, desert), deserts were most sensitive to disturbance. Finally, sites of intermediate disturbance were most diverse and exhibited characteristics associated with increased disease spread. Anthropogenic disturbance was associated with conditions conducive to increased transmission of flea-borne diseases.},

380, 2197–2223. (doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61689-4)) estimated country-level morbidity and mortality associated with a variety of factors, including infectious diseases, for the years 1990 and 2010. Unlike other databases that report disease prevalence or count outbreaks per country, Murray et al. report health impacts in per-person disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), allowing comparison across diseases with lethal and sublethal health effects. We investigated the spatial and temporal relationships between DALYs lost to infectious disease and potential demographic, economic, environmental and biotic drivers, for the 60 intermediate-sized countries where data were available and comparable. Most drivers had unique associations with each disease. For example, temperature was positively associated with some diseases and negatively associated with others, perhaps due to differences in disease agent thermal optima, transmission modes and host species identities. Biodiverse countries tended to have high disease burdens, consistent with the expectation that high diversity of potential hosts should support high disease transmission. Contrary to the dilution effect hypothesis, increases in biodiversity over time were not correlated with improvements in human health, and increases in forestation over time were actually associated with increased disease burden. Urbanization and wealth were associated with lower burdens for many diseases, a pattern that could arise from increased access to sanitation and healthcare in cities and increased investment in healthcare. The importance of urbanization and wealth helps to explain why most infectious diseases have become less burdensome over the past three decades, and points to possible levers for further progress in improving global public health., This article is part of the themed issue ‘Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications’.},

	abstract = {The notion of a critical community size (CCS), or population size that is likely to result in long-term persistence of a communicable disease, has been developed based on the empirical observations of acute immunizing infections in human populations, and extended for use in wildlife populations. Seasonal birth pulses are frequently observed in wildlife and are expected to impact infection dynamics, yet their effect on pathogen persistence and CCS have not been considered. To investigate this issue theoretically, we use stochastic epidemiological models to ask how host life-history traits and infection parameters interact to determine pathogen persistence within a closed population. We fit seasonal birth pulse models to data from diverse mammalian species in order to identify realistic parameter ranges. When varying the synchrony of the birth pulse with all other parameters being constant, our model predicted that the CCS can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Tighter birth pulses tended to drive pathogen extinction by creating large amplitude oscillations in prevalence, especially with high demographic turnover and short infectious periods. Parameters affecting the relative timing of the epidemic and birth pulse peaks determined the intensity and direction of the effect of pre-existing immunity in the population on the pathogen's ability to persist beyond the initial epidemic following its introduction.},

The average CF among patients with confirmed LF declined from 154/355 (43\%) in 2001–09 to 183/867 (21.1\%) (OR [95\% CI] = 2.9 [2.2, 3.7], p {\textless} 0.001) in 2011–18. The annual CF declined from 94\% in 2001 to 15\% in 2018 whereas the caseload increased from 0.3 to 3.4\%. The outbreaks were characterized by irregular cycles of high caseload in 2005–2007, 2012–2014, and 2016–2018, and progressive blurring of the seasonality., Conclusion: LF outbreaks in Nigeria have upgraded spatially and temporally, with the potential for cycles of increasing severity. The strategic establishment of LF surveillance and clinical case management centers could be a pragmatic and cost-effective approach to mitigating the outbreaks, particularly in reducing the associated CF. Urgent efforts are needed in reinvigorating extant control measures while the search for sustainable solutions continues.},

	abstract = {Background Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa. However, none of the hospitals in the endemic areas of Nigeria has the capacity to perform Lassa virus diagnostics. Case identification and management solely relies on non-specific clinical criteria. The Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital (ISTH) in the central senatorial district of Edo State struggled with this challenge for many years. Methodology/Principal Findings A laboratory for molecular diagnosis of Lassa fever, complying with basic standards of diagnostic PCR facilities, was established at ISTH in 2008. During 2009 through 2010, samples of 1,650 suspected cases were processed, of which 198 (12\%) tested positive by Lassa virus RT-PCR. No remarkable demographic differences were observed between PCR-positive and negative patients. The case fatality rate for Lassa fever was 31\%. Nearly two thirds of confirmed cases attended the emergency departments of ISTH. The time window for therapeutic intervention was extremely short, as 50\% of the fatal cases died within 2 days of hospitalization—often before ribavirin treatment could be commenced. Fatal Lassa fever cases were older (p = 0.005), had lower body temperature (p{\textless}0.0001), and had higher creatinine (p{\textless}0.0001) and blood urea levels (p{\textless}0.0001) than survivors. Lassa fever incidence in the hospital followed a seasonal pattern with a peak between November and March. Lassa virus sequences obtained from the patients originating from Edo State formed—within lineage II—a separate clade that could be further subdivided into three clusters. Conclusions/Significance Lassa fever case management was improved at a tertiary health institution in Nigeria through establishment of a laboratory for routine diagnostics of Lassa virus. Data collected in two years of operation demonstrate that Lassa fever is a serious public health problem in Edo State and reveal new insights into the disease in hospitalized patients.},

The disease is endemic in some parts of West Africa including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria; while other neighboring countries are at high risk of its outbreak since the animal vectors are distributed throughout the region.
Methods: This research adopted a retrospective mixed cohort study that analysed the treatment history containing the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of 52 laboratory-confirmed LF cases that were admitted to the Kenema Government Hospital Lassa Fever Ward during 2016 to 2018; i.e. during the immediate post Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. The patients whose treatment histories were analysed came from either within or outside Kenema district where the Lassa Fever treatment lab is located.
Results: Majority (59.6\%, n = 31/52) of the Lassa fever cases recorded during the period under review were adults; females (65.4\%, n = 34/52). The year 2016 recorded more (40.4\%, n = 21/52) Lassa Fever cases; 2017 (28.8\%, n = 15/52) and 2018(30.8\%, n = 16/52).
Conclusions: We highlighted the significance of Lassa fever prevention and control measures that can target its seasonal epidemics. These measures could include strategies that can reduce human contact with the rodent vectors as well as raise sensitization and awareness about Lassa Fever among local residents especially those residing along the Lassa Fever belt in eastern Sierra Leone.},

Lassa fever has been seldom investigated outside of a few hyperendemic regions, where the described epidemiology may differ from that in areas of low or moderate incidence of disease. Through a prospective cohort study, we investigated the epidemiology and clinical presentation of Lassa fever in Guinea, where the disease has been infrequently recognized. A surveillance system was established, and suspected cases were enrolled at five Guinean hospitals. Clinical observations were made, and blood was taken for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing and isolation of Lassa virus. Lassa fever was confirmed in 22 (7\%) of 311 suspected cases. Another 43 (14\%) had Lassa IgG antibodies, indicating past exposure. Both sexes and a wide variety of age and ethnic groups were affected. The disease was more frequently found, and the IgG seroprevalence generally higher, in the southeastern forest region. In some areas, there were significant discrepancies between the incidence of Lassa fever and the prevalence of antibody. Clinical presentations between those with Lassa fever and other febrile illnesses were essentially indistinguishable. Clinical predictors of a poor outcome were noted, but again were not specific for Lassa fever. Case-fatality rates for those with Lassa fever and non-Lassa febrile illnesses were 18\% and 15\%, respectively. Seasonal fluctuation in the incidence of Lassa fever was noted, but occurred similarly with non-Lassa febrile illnesses. Our results, perhaps typical of the scenario throughout much of West Africa, indicate Lassa virus infection to be widespread in certain areas of Guinea, but difficult to distinguish clinically.},

The reservoir of Lassa virus is the multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis), a highly commensal species in West Africa. Primary transmission to humans occurs through direct or indirect contact with rodent body fluids such as urine, feces, saliva, or blood. Our research draws together qualitative and quantitative methods to provide a fuller and more nuanced perspective on these varied points of human-animal contact. In this article, we focus on the hunting, preparation, and consumption of rodents as possible routes of exposure in Bo, Sierra Leone. We found that the consumption of rodents, including the reservoir species, is widespread and does not neatly tally against generational or gender lines. Further, we found that the reasons for rodent consumption are multifactorial, including taste preferences, food security, and opportunistic behavior. We argue that on certain topics, such as rodent consumption, establishing trust with communities, and using qualitative research methods, is key to investigate sensitive issues and situate them in their wider context. To conclude, we recommend ways to refine sensitization campaigns to account for these socio-cultural contexts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic illness responsible for disease outbreaks across West Africa. It is a zoonosis, with the primary reservoir species identified as the Natal multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis. The host is distributed across sub-Saharan Africa while the virus' range appears to be restricted to West Africa. The majority of infections result from interactions between the animal reservoir and human populations, although secondary transmission between humans can occur, particularly in hospital settings.
METHODS: Using a species distribution model, the locations of confirmed human and animal infections with Lassa virus (LASV) were used to generate a probabilistic surface of zoonotic transmission potential across sub-Saharan Africa.
RESULTS: Our results predict that 37.7 million people in 14 countries, across much of West Africa, live in areas where conditions are suitable for zoonotic transmission of LASV. Four of these countries, where at-risk populations are predicted, have yet to report any cases of Lassa fever.
CONCLUSIONS: These maps act as a spatial guide for future surveillance activities to better characterise the geographical distribution of the disease and understand the anthropological, virological and zoological interactions necessary for viral transmission. Combining this zoonotic niche map with detailed patient travel histories can aid differential diagnoses of febrile illnesses, enabling a more rapid response in providing care and reducing the risk of onward transmission.},

	abstract = {AbstractThe multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir for Lassa virus (LASV). Zoonotic transmission occurs when humans are directly or indirectly exposed to fluids of the multimammate mouse, such as urine, saliva, and blood. Housing characteristics and domestic organization affect rodent density in and around households and villages, and are likely to be a risk factor for Lassa fever in humans where the reservoir exists. We use semi-structured interviews (N = 51), a quantitative survey (N = 429), direct observations, and a rodent ecology study to provide new insights into how the organization of domestic spaces brings together humans and rodents and creates pathways for infection in rural settlements in Bo District, Sierra Leone. Rodents were frequently reported inside houses (92.4\% of respondents), in which we predominantly trapped M. natalensis (57\% of trapped rodents) and Rattus rattus (38\% of trapped rodents). Building design and materials provide hiding and nesting places for rodents and lead to close proximity with humans. Patterns of contact are both unintentional and intentional and research participants reported high levels of contact with rodents (34.2\% of respondents) and rodent fluids (52.8\% of respondents). Rodents are also perceived as a serious threat to food security. These results present detailed knowledge about how humans live with and come into contact with rodents, including the LASV reservoir. Our results argue for further collaborative research in housing and environmental modification such as ceiling construction, food storage, and sanitation as prevention against zoonotic LASV transmission.},

Six well-supported phylogroups, differentiated during the Pleistocene, were evidenced. No significant correlation between genetic and geographic distances was found at the continental scale, and the geographic distributions of the observed phylogroups have resulted from extensive periods of isolation caused by the presence of putative geographic and ecological barriers. The diversification events were probably influenced by habitat contraction/expansion cycles that may have complemented topographic barriers to induce genetic drift and lineage sorting. According to our results, we propose a scenario where climate-driven processes may have played a primary role in the differentiation among phylogroups. © 2013 The Linnean Society of London},

	abstract = {Background
Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease endemic in Nigeria. The 2018 Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria was unprecedented, with 8\% of all cases occurring among healthcare workers (HCWs). A disproportionately high number of these infections occurred in HCWs working in a tertiary health facility in Nigeria. This paper describes the cluster of Lassa fever infections among HCWs in a treatment centre and the lessons learnt.
Methods
We analysed clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data from surveillance and laboratory records kept during the 2018 outbreak. Interviews were conducted with surviving HCWs using a questionnaire developed specifically for the investigation of Lassa fever infections in HCWs. Descriptive analysis of the data was performed in Microsoft excel.
Results
The index case was a 15-year-old male who presented at the health facility with fever and uncontrolled nasopharyngeal bleeding, following a recent uvulectomy by a traditional healer. Overall, 16 HCWs were affected (15 confirmed and 1 probable) with five deaths (CFR-31.6\%). Of the 15 confirmed cases, five (33.3\%) were asymptomatic. Nine HCWs were direct contacts of the index case; the remaining six HCWs had no direct contact with the index case. HCW interviews identified a low index of suspicion for Lassa fever leading to inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) practices as possible contributing factors to nosocomial transmission.
Conclusion
Maintaining a high index of suspicion for Lassa fever in all patients, especially in endemic areas, is essential in adhering to adequate IPC practices in health facilities in order to prevent nosocomial transmission of Lassa fever among HCWs. There is a need to continually train and sensitise HCWs on strict adherence to IPC measures while providing care, irrespective of a patient’s provisional diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Puumala virus (PUUV) is a hantavirus specifically harboured by the bank vole, Myodes (earlier Clethrionomys) glareolus. It causes a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in humans, called Nephropathia epidemica (NE). The clinical severity of NE is variable among patients and depends on their major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genetic background. In this study we investigated the potential role of class II MHC gene polymorphism in the susceptibility/resistance to PUUV in the wild reservoir M. glareolus. We performed an association study between the exon 2 of the DQA gene and PUUV antibodies considering a natural population of bank voles. Because immune gene polymorphism is likely to be driven by multiple parasites in the wild, we also screened bank voles for other potential viral and parasitic infections. We used multivariate analyses to explore DQA polymorphism/PUUV associations while considering the potential antagonist and/or synergistic effects of the whole parasite community. Our study suggests links between class II MHC characteristics and viral infections including PUUV and Cowpox virus. Several alleles are likely to be involved in the susceptibility or in the resistance of bank voles to these infections. Alternatively, heterozygosity does not seem to be associated with PUUV or any other parasite infections. This result thus provides no evidence in favour of the hypothesis of selection through overdominance. Finally this multivariate approach reveals a strong antagonism between ectoparasitic mites and PUUV, suggesting direct or indirect immunogenetic links between infections by these parasites. Other datasets are now required to confirm these results and to test whether the associations vary in space and/or time.},

	abstract = {Background
Lassa fever (LF) is a viral hemorrhagic disease caused by the Lassa virus (LASV) and endemic in West African countries with an estimation of 300,000 to 500,000 cases and 5,000 deaths annually. The Margibi County Health Team of Liberia received a report of an unidentified febrile illness case from the Kakata district. We conducted the investigation to identify the causative agent and the source of infection to support treatment, control and prevention interventions.

Case presentation
We identified LASV in the blood specimens’ of two patients by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Both the confirmed cases have manifested respiratory distress, weakness, and difficulty of swallowing, muscle, joint and back pains, and vomiting with blood. The symptoms started with mild fever and gradually developed. Initially, the primary health facilities have miss-diagnosed the patients as malaria and respiratory tract infections. The primary health facilities have referred the patients to the referral hospital as the patients have failed to respond to antimalarial and antibiotics. The hospital suspected LF and sent blood specimens to the National Reference Laboratory while the patients were on supportive treatment in the isolation room. At the time when the laboratory result returned to the hospital, the patients died of LF illness before ribavirin administered.

Conclusions
Our investigation revealed that the two hospitalized and deceased febrile cases were associated with LASV. The primary health facilities have failed to recognize the cases as suspected LF at the earliest time possible. The clinicians and health facilities, especially primary health facilities, need to consider LF as a differential diagnosis when the patient failed to respond to anti-malaria and broad-spectrum antibiotics.},

	abstract = {Lassa virus is genetically diverse with several lineages circulating in West Africa. This study aimed at describing the sequence variability of Lassa virus across Nigeria and inferring its spatiotemporal evolution. We sequenced and isolated 77 Lassa virus strains from 16 Nigerian states. The final data set, including previous works, comprised metadata and sequences of 219 unique strains sampled between 1969 and 2018 in 22 states. Most of this data originated from Lassa fever patients diagnosed at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Edo State, Nigeria. The majority of sequences clustered with the main Nigerian lineages II and III, while a few sequences formed a new cluster related to Lassa virus strains from Hylomyscus pamfi Within lineages II and III, seven and five sublineages, respectively, were distinguishable. Phylogeographic analysis suggests an origin of lineage II in the southeastern part of the country around Ebonyi State and a main vector of dispersal toward the west across the Niger River, through Anambra, Kogi, Delta, and Edo into Ondo State. The frontline of virus dispersal appears to be in Ondo. Minor vectors are directed northeast toward Taraba and Adamawa and south toward Imo and Rivers. Lineage III might have spread from northern Plateau State into Kaduna, Nasarawa, Federal Capital Territory, and Bauchi. One sublineage moved south and crossed the Benue River into Benue State. This study provides a geographic mapping of lineages and phylogenetic clusters in Nigeria at a higher resolution. In addition, we estimated the direction and time frame of virus dispersal in the country.IMPORTANCE Lassa virus is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever with a case fatality rate of approximately 30\% in Africa. Previous studies disclosed a geographical pattern in the distribution of Lassa virus strains and a westward movement of the virus across West Africa during evolution. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the geography of genetic lineages and sublineages of the virus in Nigeria. In addition, we modeled how the virus spread in the country. This knowledge allows us to predict into which geographical areas the virus might spread in the future and prioritize areas for Lassa fever surveillance. Our study not only aimed to generate Lassa virus sequences from across Nigeria but also to isolate and conserve the respective viruses for future research. Both isolates and sequences are important for the development and evaluation of medical countermeasures to treat and prevent Lassa fever, such as diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.},

	abstract = {As part of a large survey on reservoirs of Lassa fever in Guinea, three villages were investigated in high endemic zone, close to Sierra Leone border. Biodiversity of the small mammal community is presented in this study through a standardized trapping in houses, cultivations and forest. Identification of the small mammals was based on morphology and by molecular technique for sibling species. Of the 1123 specimens collected in 2003–2005, we identified seventeen species (thirteen Muridae, four Soricidae), leading to high diversity (Shannon index = 1.6–1.8) and high equitability (evenness index = 0.7–0.8) in cultivations and forest. In houses conversely, the rodent community was dominated by Mastomys natalensis (95–98\%), leading to low diversity and equitability. Dynamics and reproduction were investigated in two species of pygmy mice, Mus mattheyi and Mus minutoides, two species of Praomys, P. daltoni and P. rostratus, and in Mastomys erythroleucus. The pygmy mice were abundant in cultivations in early rainy season, and reproduced from rainy to dry season. Praomys daltoni was also found more abundant in cultivations and seemed to reproduce between rainy and dry season, whereas P. rostratus preferred forest and cultivations in late rainy season, and reproduced throughout the year. Finally, M. erythroleucus was more abundant in forest in dry season, and seemed to reproduce from late rainy to dry season. This species had a low occurrence (6.5\%) in the Faranah’s zone, and probably lived at its southern limit in Guinea. The presence of other Murinae, such as M. natalensis, Praomys spp as possible competitors in the same habitats, is discussed. For the first time, this study relates population biology of pygmy mice with molecular identification.},

Here, the association of LASV prevalence with fecundity, fertility, and the age structure of the rodent population was analyzed using data from the previous study. The animals reproduced throughout the year, but highest fecundity was observed during the rainy season. Accordingly, the rodent population was aged at the beginning and young at the end of the rainy season. Lassa virus infection was observed in all age groups, including the very young, which is compatible with vertical transmission. However, since the prevalence of infection showed a trend with increasing age in the younger age groups, horizontal transmission by yet unknown mechanisms may also play a role in LASV transmission. Multivariate analysis did not show an association of LASV prevalence with any demographic variable studied. Rodent behavior influencing virus transmissibility and contaminated environment may therefore be responsible for spatial and seasonal variations in LASV prevalence in M. natalensis.},

	abstract = {Based on empiric surveillance data, the incidence of human Lassa fever (LF) cases in Guinea and other West African countries has been reported to increase during the dry season compared to the rainy season. To investigate possible links with the ecology of the rodent reservoir of the virus, we conducted a 2-year longitudinal survey of Mastomys natalensis in a region of high human Lassa virus (LASV) seropositivity in Guinea. Standardized rodent trapping with similar trapping efforts between seasons was performed in three villages and 53.5\% (601/1123) of the animals were identified as M. natalensis using morphometric and molecular criteria. Mean trapping success (TS) of M. natalensis was always higher inside houses than in proximal cultivations. In the dry season, mean TS increased 2-fold inside houses and decreased up to 10-fold outside (p {\textless} 0.0001), suggesting aggregation of rodents inside houses due to restricted food supply. 14.5\% (80/553) of M. natalensis were tested positive for Lassa virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; range, 5\%-30\%) and prevalence of the virus was two to three times higher in rodents captured in the rainy season than in the dry season (p {\textless} 0.05). Inside houses, however, the LASV prevalence fluctuated nonsignificantly with season. These data suggest that in Guinea the risk of LASV transmission from rodents to humans is present both in the rainy and the dry season, reflected by the occurrence of LF cases throughout the year. In the dry season, however, the increased risk of humans encountering Mastomys and their excreta inside of houses may result in an increase of human Lassa fever cases.},

To this end, we generated 132 partial nucleoprotein sequences of LASV from M. natalensis trapped in 12 villages around Faranah, Upper Guinea, over a period of 12 years. This study reveals two main features of LASV evolution in M. natalensis. First, the virus evolves in the reservoir with a molecular clock rate of 9 (7-11) × 10(-4) position(-1) year(-1) implying that contemporary LASV lineages circulate in the Faranah area since less than 100 years. Second, viruses circulating in a specific village are diverse and polyphyletic. We observed, however, there are monophyletic clusters at village and sub-village level at specific points in time. In conclusion, our data indicate that the temporal and spatial pattern of LASV evolution in the natural reservoir is characterized by a combination of stationary circulation within a village and virus movement between villages. The latter feature is relevant for rodent control strategies, as it implies that recurrence of the virus from neighbouring villages may occur in villages where the virus has previously been eradicated.},

	abstract = {Background Lassa fever is caused by a viral haemorrhagic arenavirus that affects two to three million people in West Africa, causing a mortality of between 5,000 and 10,000 each year. The natural reservoir of Lassa virus is the multi-mammate rat Mastomys natalensis, which lives in houses and surrounding fields. With the aim of gaining more information to control this disease, we here carry out a spatial analysis of Lassa fever data from human cases and infected rodent hosts covering the period 1965–2007. Information on contemporary environmental conditions (temperature, rainfall, vegetation) was derived from NASA Terra MODIS satellite sensor data and other sources and for elevation from the GTOPO30 surface for the region from Senegal to the Congo. All multi-temporal data were analysed using temporal Fourier techniques to generate images of means, amplitudes and phases which were used as the predictor variables in the models. In addition, meteorological rainfall data collected between 1951 and 1989 were used to generate a synoptic rainfall surface for the same region. Methodology/Principal Findings Three different analyses (models) are presented, one superimposing Lassa fever outbreaks on the mean rainfall surface (Model 1) and the other two using non-linear discriminant analytical techniques. Model 2 selected variables in a step-wise inclusive fashion, and Model 3 used an information-theoretic approach in which many different random combinations of 10 variables were fitted to the Lassa fever data. Three combinations of absence∶presence clusters were used in each of Models 2 and 3, the 2 absence∶1 presence cluster combination giving what appeared to be the best result. Model 1 showed that the recorded outbreaks of Lassa fever in human populations occurred in zones receiving between 1,500 and 3,000 mm rainfall annually. Rainfall, and to a much lesser extent temperature variables, were most strongly selected in both Models 2 and 3, and neither vegetation nor altitude seemed particularly important. Both Models 2 and 3 produced mean kappa values in excess of 0.91 (Model 2) or 0.86 (Model 3), making them ‘Excellent’. Conclusion/Significance The Lassa fever areas predicted by the models cover approximately 80\% of each of Sierra Leone and Liberia, 50\% of Guinea, 40\% of Nigeria, 30\% of each of Côte d'Ivoire, Togo and Benin, and 10\% of Ghana.},

However, our knowledge of LF ecology, epidemiology and distribution is limited, which presents barriers to both short-term disease forecasting and prediction of long-term impacts of environmental change on Lassa virus (LASV) zoonotic transmission dynamics. Here, we synthesize current knowledge to show that extrapolations from past research have produced an incomplete picture of the incidence and distribution of LF, with negative consequences for policy planning, medical treatment and management interventions. Although the recent increase in LF case reports is likely due to improved surveillance, recent studies suggest that future socio-ecological changes in West Africa may drive increases in LF burden.

Four individuals show three alleles implying a duplication event in the history of this gene. Each distinct sequence translates to give a distinct amino acid sequence and there are strong signals of positive selection on peptide binding sites. Signals of recombination were found in the sequences suggesting that recombination has played a role in generating allelic diversity. Although trans-taxon polymorphism is present at the interspecific level in DQB exon 2 sequences of Mus species, we did not find any evidence of allele sharing among Muridae genera. This indicates a temporal limit of DQB allele sharing in Muridae of less than 8 Mya. In conclusion, although DQB seems to be a good marker to investigate pathogen-driven selection, the polymorphism of gene copy number may restrict its utility in natural populations.},

Surprisingly, the virus is not closely related with Morogoro virus that infects M. natalensis only 90km south of Gairo, but clusters phylogenetically with Mobala-like viruses that infect non-M. natalensis host species in Central African Republic and Ethiopia. Despite the evolutionary distance, Gairo virus shares basic ecological features with the other M. natalensis-borne viruses Lassa and Morogoro. Our data show that M. natalensis, carrying distantly related viruses even in the same geographical area, is a potent reservoir host for a variety of arenaviruses.},

A long-range reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction allowed amplification of the full-length (3.4 kb) S RNA. The coding sequences of strain AV differed from those of all known Lassa prototype strains (Josiah, Nigeria, and LP) by approximately 20\%, mainly at third codon positions. Phylogenetically, strain AV appears to be most closely related to strain Josiah from Sierra Leone. Lassa viruses comprise a group of genetically highly diverse strains, which has implications for vaccine development.

New insights have been gained in the pathogenesis and molecular epidemiology of Lassa fever, and state-of the-art technologies for diagnosing this life-threatening disease have been developed. The intention of this review is to summarize in particular the recent literature on Lassa virus and Lassa fever. Several aspects ranging from basic research up to clinical practice and laboratory diagnosis are discussed and linked together.},

The Mammarenaviruses contain viruses responsible for causing human hemorrhagic fever diseases including New World (NW) viruses Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, Sabia, and Chapare virus and Old World (OW) viruses Lassa, and Lujo virus. These two groups of arenaviruses share the same genome organization composed of two ambisense RNA segments. These segments contain four open reading frames (ORFs) that encode for four proteins: the nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein precursor (GPC), L protein (LP), and Z. Despite their genome similarities, these groups exhibit marked differences in their replication life cycles. This includes differences in attachment, entry, and immune evasion. By understanding the intricacy of replication in each of these viral species we can work to develop counter measures against human diseases. This includes the development of vaccines and antivirals for these emerging viral threats. Currently only the vaccine against Junin virus, Candid\#1, is in use as well as Ribavirin for treatment of Lassa Fever (LF). In addition, small molecule inhibitors can be developed to target various aspects of the virus life cycle. In these ways an understanding of the arenavirus replication cycle can be used to alleviate the mortality and morbidity of these infections worldwide.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Hospital-acquired infections of Lassa fever (LF) have been described in many West African countries. We assessed the availability of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures and their use in the health centres (HCs) at the affected Local Government Areas (LGAs) during an ongoing LF outbreak in Ondo State, Nigeria.

Methods
We included all primary and secondary HCs and their healthcare workers (HCWs) in the affected Ose and Owo LGAs. We collected data from respondents using self-administered questionnaires and used a checklist to assess the IPC measures at the HCs. We generated frequencies and proportions and tested associations using odds ratios at 95\% CI.

Results
One hundred and ninety HCWs from 59 HCs were surveyed of which 34 (57.6\%) were located in Owo LGA. All HCs had soap for handwashing, 57(96.6\%) had wash-hand basins but only 52(88.1\%) had water. While 57(96.6\%) had gloves and 53(89.8\%) had sharps boxes, only 16(27.1\%) had an isolation room. Only 44(23.2\%) respondents had been trained in IPC. The majority, 144 (91.6\%) always had gloves available for their use, 79(41.6\%) always had facemask/shield and 71(37.4\%) always had full personal protective equipment. At the last patient contact, only 151 (79.8\%) washed their hands before the contact, 188(98.9\%) washed their hands after and 183 (96.2\%) wore gloves. While there was no association between availability of gloves and its use (OR: 0.21, 95\%CI 0.04-1.17), there was significant association between having had training in basic universal precautions and having used gloves (OR: 3.64, 95\%CI 1.21-19.40) and having washed hands after last patient contact (OR: 2.31, 95\%CI 1.67-12.30).

Conclusion
Among these HCs that serve as point of first contact with possible cases of LF in these endemic LGAs, none met the minimum standard for IPC. We recommend that IPC committee for each LGA and the whole state should be set up and IPC trainings made mandatory.},

LASV glycoprotein (GP) expresses this diversity, but most LASV vaccine candidates utilize only the Lineage IV LASV Josiah strain GP antigen as an immunogen and homologous challenge with Lineage IV LASV. In addition to the sequence variation amongst the LASV lineages, these lineages are also distinguished in their presentations. Inter-lineage variations within previously mapped B-cell and T-cell LASV GP epitopes and the breadth of protection in LASV vaccine/challenge studies were examined critically. Multiple alignments of the GP primary sequence of strains from each LASV lineage showed that LASV GP has diverging degrees of amino acid conservation within known epitopes among LASV lineages. Conformational B-cell epitopes spanning different sites in GP subunits were less impacted by LASV diversity. LASV GP diversity should influence the approach used for LASV vaccine design. Expression of LASV GP on viral vectors, especially in its prefusion configuration, has shown potential for protective LASV vaccines that can overcome LASV diversity. Advanced vaccine candidates should demonstrate efficacy against all LASV lineages for evidence of a pan-LASV vaccine.},

Significant global socio-ecological changes have occurred in the period of a single lifetime, driven by increased technology and access to physical and biological resources through open markets and globalization. Current resource consumption rates are not sustainable and ecological tipping points are being reached and one of the indicators of these may be a changing balance between hosts and pathogens. A period of extraordinary progress in reducing infection risk and disease impact on humans and domestic animals in the 20th Century is reversing in the 21st, but not always and not everywhere. Drivers for this shift are discussed in terms of demographics, agroecology, biodiversity decline and loss of resilience in ecosystems, climate change and increasing interconnectedness between species globally.

	abstract = {The global focus on wildlife as a major contributor to emerging pathogens and infectious diseases (EIDs) in humans and domestic animals is not based on field, experimental or dedicated research, but mostly on limited surveys of literature, opinion and the assumption that biodiversity harbours pathogens. The perceived and direct impacts of wildlife, from being a reservoir of certain human and livestock pathogens and as a risk to health, are frequently overstated when compared to the Global burden of disease statistics available from WHO, OIE and FAO. However organisms that evolve in wildlife species can and do spill-over into human landscapes and humans and domestic animal population and, where these organisms adapt to surviving and spreading amongst livestock and humans, these emerging infections can have significant consequences. Drivers for the spill-over of pathogens or evolution of organisms from wildlife reservoirs to become pathogens of humans and domestic animals are varied but almost without exception poorly researched. The changing demographics, spatial distribution and movements, associated landscape modifications (especially agricultural) and behavioural changes involving human and domestic animal populations are probably the core drivers of the apparent increasing trend in emergence of new pathogens and infectious diseases over recent decades.},

	abstract = {Environmental changes have been shown to play an important role in the emergence of new human diseases of zoonotic origin. The contribution of social factors to their spread, especially conflicts followed by mass movement of populations, has not been extensively investigated. Here we reveal the effects of civil war on the phylogeography of a zoonotic emerging infectious disease by concomitantly studying the population structure, evolution and demography of Lassa virus and its natural reservoir, the rodent Mastomys natalensis, in Guinea, West Africa. Analysis of nucleoprotein gene sequences enabled us to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Lassa virus, which appeared 750 to 900 years ago in Nigeria and only recently spread across western Africa (170 years ago). Bayesian demographic inferences revealed that both the host and the virus populations have gone recently through severe genetic bottlenecks. The timing of these events matches civil war-related mass movements of refugees and accompanying environmental degradation. Forest and habitat destruction and human predation of the natural reservoir are likely explanations for the sharp decline observed in the rodent populations, the consequent virus population decline, and the coincident increased incidence of Lassa fever in these regions. Interestingly, we were also able to detect a similar pattern in Nigeria coinciding with the Biafra war. Our findings show that anthropogenic factors may profoundly impact the population genetics of a virus and its reservoir within the context of an emerging infectious disease.},

The highest prevalence of LVA (25-55\%) was found among inhabitants of tropical secondary forest (areas near Gueckedou, Yomou, and Lola) and guinea savannah (Faranah and Kindia areas), near the southern frontiers with Sierra Leone and Liberia. A much lower prevalence (4-7\%) was found among inhabitants of mountainous (Pita, Labe, and Mali) and coastal (Boffa, Boké) areas. We found no discernible differences in LVA prevalence between males and females or among various age groups. Testing of 406 hospital staff members of the eight central hospitals in these areas for LVA revealed a similar distribution of seropositivity among hospitals in various prefectures.

	abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus (LASV), an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. While previous studies suggest that spillover risk is focal within rural villages due to the spatial behaviour of the rodents, the level of clustering was never specifically assessed. Nevertheless, detailed information on the spatial distribution of infected rodents would be highly valuable to optimize LASV-control campaigns, which are limited to rodent control or interrupting human–rodent contact considering that a human vaccine is not available. Here, we analysed data from a four-year field experiment to investigate whether LASV-infected rodents cluster in households in six rural villages in Guinea. Our analyses were based on the infection status (antibody or PCR) and geolocation of rodents (n = 864), and complemented with a phylogenetic analysis of LASV sequences (n = 119). We observed that the majority of infected rodents were trapped in a few houses (20\%) and most houses were rodent-free at a specific point in time (60\%). We also found that LASV strains circulating in a specific village were polyphyletic with respect to neighbouring villages, although most strains grouped together at the sub-village level and persisted over time. In conclusion, our results suggest that: (i) LASV spillover risk is heterogeneously distributed within villages in Guinea; (ii) viral elimination in one particular village is unlikely if rodents are not controlled in neighbouring villages. Such spatial information should be incorporated into eco-epidemiological models that assess the cost-efficiency of LASV control strategies.},

	abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa arenavirus, the etiological agent of Lassa fever in humans. Because there exists no vaccine for human use, rodent control and adjusting human behavior are currently considered to be the only options for Lassa fever control. In order to develop efficient rodent control programs, more information about the host's ecology is needed. In this study, we investigated the spatial behavior of M. natalensis and other small rodents in two capture-mark-recapture and four dyed bait (Rhodamine B) experiments in Lassa fever-endemic villages in Upper Guinea. During the capture-mark-recapture studies, 23\% of the recaptured M. natalensis moved between the houses and proximate fields. While M. natalensis was found over the entire study grid (2 ha), other rodent species (Praomys daltoni, Praomys rostratus, Lemniscomys striatus, Mus spp.) were mostly trapped in the surrounding fields. Distances between recapture occasions never exceeded 100 m for all rodent species. During the dyed bait experiments, 11\% of M. natalensis and 41\% of P. daltoni moved from the fields to houses. We conclude that commensal M. natalensis easily moves between houses and proximate fields in Guinea. We therefore consider occasional domestic rodent elimination to be an unsustainable approach to reduce Lassa virus transmission risk to humans, as M. natalensis is likely to reinvade houses quickly from fields in which rodents are not controlled. A combination of permanent rodent elimination with other control strategies (e.g., make houses rodent proof or attract predators) could be more effective for Lassa fever control, but must be further investigated.},

	abstract = {Although an association between Lassa fever (LF) and sudden-onset sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) was confirmed clinically in 1990, the prevalence of LF-induced SNHL in endemic countries is still underestimated. LF, a viral hemorrhagic fever disease caused by Lassa virus (LASV), is endemic in West Africa, causing an estimated 500,000 cases and 5,000 deaths per year. Sudden-onset SNHL, one complication of LF, occurs in approximately one-third of survivors and constitutes a neglected public health and social burden. In the endemic countries, where access to hearing aids is limited, SNHL results in a decline of the quality of life for those affected. In addition, hearing loss costs Nigeria approximately 43 million dollars per year. The epidemiology of LF-induced SNHL has not been characterized well. The complication of LF induced by SNHL is also an important consideration for vaccine development and treatments. However, research into the mechanism has been hindered by the lack of autopsy samples and relevant small animal models. Recently, the first animal model that mimics the symptoms of SNHL associated with LF was developed. Preliminary data from the new animal model as well as the clinical case studies support the mechanism of immune-mediated injury that causes SNHL in LF patients. This article summarizes clinical findings of hearing loss in LF patients highlighting the association between LASV infection and SNHL as well as the potential mechanism(s) for LF-induced SNHL. Further research is necessary to identify the mechanism and the epidemiology of LF-induced SNHL.},

The committee determined that, given their potential to cause a public health emergency and the absence of efficacious drugs and/or vaccines, there is an urgent need for accelerated R\&D for (in no order of priority) Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease, Lassa fever, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Nipah and henipaviral diseases, Rift Valley fever and Zika virus disease.

Antibody prevalence was 2.6\% (6 of 232) in Pita compared with 14.0\% (105 of 751) in Gueckedou, with up to 35.0\% seropositivity in selected villages of the higher prevalence area. We observed three major risk factors in Gueckedou favoring Lassa virus transmission: rodent infestation was much higher, food was more often stored uncovered and most strikingly, peridomestic rodents were hunted as a protein source by 91.5\% of the population as opposed to 0\% in Pita. To control for the confounding effects of differences in rodent infestation and food storage, rodent consumption was analyzed as a risk factor for transmission of Lassa virus comparing rodent consumers (RC) and nonconsumers (NC) in Gueckedou only: 14.6\% of RC had Lassa virus antibodies versus 7.4\% of NC (P = 0.1) and 23.0\% of RC reported a history of a febrile illness with hearing loss (the most common sequel of Lassa fever) versus 6.1\% of NC (P = 0.003).},

The present review contextualizes the risk factors that result from human interactions with livestock, companion animals, animal exhibits, wildlife through nature-based tourism, and wildlife through consumption. Given their phylogenetic relatedness to humans, primates are emphasized in this discussion; primates serve as reservoirs for several human pathogens, and some human pathogens can decimate wild primate populations. Anthropologists must play a central role in understanding cultural variation in attitudes toward other species as well as perceived risks when interacting with animals. I argue that the remediation of emerging infectious diseases will be accomplished primarily through human behavioral changes rather than through efforts in pathogen discovery. Given the history of human interactions with wildlife, candid discussions on zoonotic diseases will be increasingly important for our combined survival.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE--To investigate two hospital outbreaks of Lassa fever in southern central Nigeria. SETTING--Hospitals and clinics in urban and rural areas of Imo State, Nigeria. DESIGN--Medical records were reviewed in hospitals and clinics in both areas. Patients with presumed and laboratory confirmed Lassa fever were identified and contracts traced. Hospital staff, patients, and local residents were questioned, records were carefully reviewed, and serum samples were taken. Serum samples were assayed for antibody specific to Lassa virus, and isolates of Lassa virus were obtained. RESULTS--Among 34 patients with Lassa fever, including 20 patients, six nurses, two surgeons, one physician, and the son of a patient, there were 22 deaths (65\% fatality rate). Eleven cases were laboratory confirmed, five by isolation of virus. Most patients had been exposed in hospitals (attack rate in patients in one hospital 55\%). Both outbreak hospitals were inadequately equipped and staffed, with poor medical practice. Compelling, indirect evidence revealed that parenteral drug rounds with sharing of syringes, conducted by minimally educated and supervised staff, fuelled the epidemic among patients. Staff were subsequently infected during emergency surgery and while caring for nosocomially infected patients. CONCLUSION--This outbreak illustrates the high price exacted by the practice of modern medicine, particularly use of parenteral injections and surgery, without due attention to good medical practice. High priority must be given to education of medical staff in developing countries and to guidelines for safe operation of clinics and hospitals. Failure to do so will have far reaching, costly, and ultimately devastating consequences.},

The virus exhibits persistent, asymptomatic infection with profuse urinary virus excretion in the ubiquitous rodent vector, Mastomys natalensis. Lassa fever is endemic in West Africa and has been reported from Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria. Some studies indicate that 300,000 to 500,000 cases of Lassa fever and 5000 deaths occur yearly across West Africa. Studies reported in English, that investigated Lassa fever with reference to West Africa were identified using the Medline Entrez-PubMed search and were used for this review. The scarcity of resources available for health care delivery system and the political instability that characterise the West African countries would continue to impede efforts for the control of Lassa fever in the sub-region. There is need for adequate training of health care workers regarding diagnostics, intensive care of patients under isolation, contact tracing, adequate precautionary measures in handling infectious laboratory specimens, control of the vector as well as care and disposal of infectious waste.},

We found evidence that LASV is also hosted by other rodent species: the African wood mouse Hylomyscus pamfi in Nigeria, and the Guinea multimammate mouse Mastomys erythroleucus in both Nigeria and Guinea. Virus strains from these animals were isolated in the BSL-4 laboratory and fully sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of viral genes coding for glycoprotein, nucleoprotein, polymerase and matrix protein show that Lassa strains detected in M. erythroleucus belong to lineages III and IV. The strain from H. pamfi clusters close to lineage I (for S gene) and between II \& III (for L gene).

We sought to elucidate the diversity and distribution of these animals (including known LASV reservoirs) geographically, habitat-wise and seasonally. Our DNA-assisted survey detected at least 19 small mammal species amongst 790 specimens. Diversity indices were similar between ecological zones and also between endemic and non-endemic areas for Lassa fever. Mastomys natalensis, the most renowned LASV host, was present in eight out of nine localities sampled. We also described the spatial occurrence of other known LASV hosts such as M. erythroleucus and Hylomyscus pamfi, including carriers of LASV-like arenaviruses such as Mus (Nannomys) spp. The most numerous rodents (Mastomys natalensis, M. erythroleucus, and Praomys daltoni) were captured mainly inside human dwellings. Reproductive activity occurred throughout the year, but led to population peaks for M. natalensis in the dry season and for M. erythroleucus and P. daltoni in the rainy season. Extensive geographic distribution of LASV rodent reservoirs, with population peaks in different seasons, shows that the risk of rodent-to-human transmission of LASV is greater than currently realized.},

The virus is endemic in West African countries, which may be due to its zoonotic nature. Lassa virus infection occurs through contact with the vector Mastomys natalensis or infected humans and can lead to wide symptoms from a mild infection to Lassa fever and to a severe fatal viral hemorrhagic fever, which include delayed cellular immunity resulting to fulminant viremia. The virus replicates through a strategy known as the Ambisense, where two RNA strands code for genes in both the sense and antisense direction that is rapid and demonstrate temporal control in replication. Different diagnostic tests for the virus are available, which range from viral culture to serological and molecular diagnostic tests. There is an urgent need to develop drugs and vaccines against the virus because the World Health Organization (WHO) has identified Lassa virus as one of the viruses that is likely to cause a future epidemic, although a research is ongoing to evaluate Lassa virus vaccine immunogenicity in the CBA/J-ML29 mouse model.

Vascular instability varies from mild to fatal shock, and hemorrhage ranges from none to life threatening.

The severity of disease caused by these agents varies tremendously; there are extremely high fatality rates in Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, and asymptomatic infection predominates in yellow fever and dengue viral infections.

workforce to third world environments. Such migration, particularly to
the African continent, increases exposure to the traditionally neglected
tropical diseases; viral hemorrhagic fevers. Although local, regional
and national Departments of Health have attempted to implement
educational and protective protocols, the ultimate treatment facilities for
these lethal, highly contagious diseases, are usually not locally available.
Beyond universal precautions transport guidelines/protocols are nonexistent. Consequently a dismal prognosis is the rule. Our experience,
in global medical assistance, reveals that the medical evacuation/
transport of patients with Ebola, Lassa fever, Marburg etc. requires
complete cooperation, as well as authorization, by all government
agencies responsible for Public Health in the country of origin as well
as the destination country. To address the transport of this unique and
growing population of infected patients we have developed and used
innovative safety measures to protect our medical teams/flight crews
from contamination during medical evacuation/transport. Those measures
include the design, in accordance with International Health Authority
Guidelines (WHO, CDC), and implementation, of a compact, portable
isolation unit (PIU), ideal for regional ground/air travel. More recently, we
have incorporated a disposable biological containment unit (BCU) into our
comprehensive protocols which is designed for a Gulfstream III, ideal for
trans-ocean/continental travel. Both the PIU and BCU enhance our ability
to medically transport infected patients. We have demonstrated that: (1)
efficient movement of the sick/infected patients has a positive impact on
their outcome and (2) the creation and credentialing of a global network
of preferred providers willing and able to accept such patients facilitates
the transfer to the nearest center of medical excellence rather than
repatriations which may not always be practical},

	abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is one of the most diverse genetic regions under pathogen-driven selection because of its central role in antigen binding and immunity. The highest MHC variability, both in terms of the number of individual alleles and gene copies, has so far been found in passerine birds; this is probably attributable to passerine adaptation to both a wide geographic range and a diverse array of habitats. If extraordinary high MHC variation and duplication rates are adaptive features under selection during the evolution of ecologically and taxonomically diverse species, then similarly diverse MHC architectures should be found in bats. Bats are an extremely species-rich mammalian group that is globally widely distributed. Many bat species roost in multitudinous groups and have high contact rates with pathogens, conspecifics, and allospecifics. We have characterized the MHC class I diversity in 116 Panamanian Seba's short-tailed bats (Carollia perspicillata), a widely distributed, generalist, neotropical species. We have detected a remarkable individual and population-level diversity of MHC class I genes, with between seven and 22 alleles and a unique genotype in each individual. This diversity is comparable with that reported in passerine birds and, in both taxonomic groups, further variability has evolved through length polymorphisms. Our findings support the hypothesis that, for species with a geographically broader range, high MHC class I variability is particularly adaptive. Investigation of the details of the underlying adaptive processes and the role of the high MHC diversity in pathogen resistance are important next steps for a better understanding of the role of bats in viral evolution and as carriers of several deadly zoonotic viruses.},

	abstract = {Human infectious diseases are a significant threat to global human health and economies (e.g. Ebola, SARs), with the majority of infectious diseases having an animal source (zoonotic). Despite their importance, the lack of a quantitative predictive framework hampers our understanding of how spillovers of zoonotic infectious diseases into the human population will be impacted by global environmental stressors. Here, we create an environmental-mechanistic model for understanding the impact of global change on the probability of zoonotic disease reservoir host–human spillover events. As a case study, we focus on Lassa fever virus (LAS). We first quantify the spatial determinants of LAS outbreaks, including the phylogeographic distribution of its reservoir host Natal multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis) (LAS host). Secondly, we use these determinants to inform our environmental-mechanistic model to estimate present-day LAS spillover events and the predicted impact of climate change, human population growth and land use by 2070. We find phylogeographic evidence to suggest that LAS is confined to only one clade of LAS host (Western clade Mastomys natalensis) and that the probability of its occurrence was a major determinant of the spatial variation in LAS historical outbreaks (69·8\%), along with human population density (20·4\%). Our estimates for present-day LAS spillover events from our environmental-mechanistic model were consistent with observed patterns, and we predict an increase in events per year by 2070 from 195 125 to 406 725 within the LAS endemic western African region. Of the component drivers, climate change and human population growth are predicted to have the largest effects by increasing landscape suitability for the host and human–host contact rates, while land-use change has only a weak impact on the number of future events. LAS spillover events did not respond uniformly to global environmental stressors, and we suggest that understanding the impact of global change on zoonotic infectious disease emergence requires an understanding of how reservoir host species respond to environmental change. Our environmental-mechanistic modelling methodology provides a novel generalizable framework to understand the impact of global change on the spillover of zoonotic diseases.},

	abstract = {Background Lassa fever is an acute viral illness characterized by multi-organ failure and hemorrhagic manifestations. Lassa fever is most frequently diagnosed in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea, although sporadic cases have been recorded in other West African countries, including Mali. The etiological agent of Lassa fever is Lassa virus (LASV), an Arenavirus which is maintained in nature and frequently transmitted to humans by Mastomys natalensis. The purpose of this study was to better define the geographic distribution of LASV-infected rodents in sub-Saharan Mali. Methodologies/Principal Findings Small mammals were live-trapped at various locations across Mali for the purpose of identifying potential zoonotic pathogens. Serological and molecular assays were employed and determined LASV infected rodents were exclusively found in the southern Mali near the border of Côte d'Ivoire. Overall, 19.4\% of Mastomys natalensis sampled in this region had evidence of LASV infection, with prevalence rates for individual villages ranging from 0 to 52\%. Full-length genomic sequences were determined using high throughput sequencing methodologies for LASV isolates generated from tissue samples of rodents collected in four villages and confirmed the phylogenetic clustering of Malian LASV with strain AV. Conclusions/Significance The risk of human infections with LASV is greatest in villages in southern Mali. Lassa fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis for febrile individuals and appropriate diagnostic techniques need to be established to determine the incidence of infection and disease in these regions.},

	abstract = {Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes play a pivotal role in vertebrate self/nonself recognition, parasite resistance and life history decisions. In evolutionary terms, the MHC’s exceptional diversity is likely maintained by sexual and pathogen-driven selection. Even though MHC-dependent mating preferences have been confirmed for many species, the sensory and genetic mechanisms underlying mate recognition remain cryptic. Since olfaction is crucial for social communication in vertebrates, variation in chemosensory receptor genes could explain MHC-dependent mating patterns. Here, we investigated whether female mate choice is based on MHC alleles and linked to variation in chemosensory trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) in the greater sac-winged bat (Saccopteryx bilineata). We sequenced several MHC and TAAR genes and related their variation to mating and paternity data. We found strong evidence for MHC class I-dependent female choice for genetically diverse and dissimilar males. We also detected a significant interaction between mate choice and the female TAAR3 genotype, with TAAR3-heterozygous females being more likely to choose MHC-diverse males. These results suggest that TAARs and olfactory cues may be key mediators in mammalian MHC-dependent mate choice. Our study may help identify the ligands involved in the chemical communication between potential mates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lassa fever (LF), an often-fatal hemorrhagic disease caused by Lassa virus (LASV), is a major public health threat in West Africa. When the violent civil conflict in Sierra Leone (1991 to 2002) ended, an international consortium assisted in restoration of the LF program at Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) in an area with the world's highest incidence of the disease.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Clinical and laboratory records of patients presenting to the KGH Lassa Ward in the post-conflict period were organized electronically. Recombinant antigen-based LF immunoassays were used to assess LASV antigenemia and LASV-specific antibodies in patients who met criteria for suspected LF. KGH has been reestablished as a center for LF treatment and research, with over 500 suspected cases now presenting yearly. Higher case fatality rates (CFRs) in LF patients were observed compared to studies conducted prior to the civil conflict. Different criteria for defining LF stages and differences in sensitivity of assays likely account for these differences. The highest incidence of LF in Sierra Leone was observed during the dry season. LF cases were observed in ten of Sierra Leone's thirteen districts, with numerous cases from outside the traditional endemic zone. Deaths in patients presenting with LASV antigenemia were skewed towards individuals less than 29 years of age. Women self-reporting as pregnant were significantly overrepresented among LASV antigenemic patients. The CFR of ribavirin-treated patients presenting early in acute infection was lower than in untreated subjects.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Lassa fever remains a major public health threat in Sierra Leone. Outreach activities should expand because LF may be more widespread in Sierra Leone than previously recognized. Enhanced case finding to ensure rapid diagnosis and treatment is imperative to reduce mortality. Even with ribavirin treatment, there was a high rate of fatalities underscoring the need to develop more effective and/or supplemental treatments for LF.},

It was estimated that seasonal and annual covariates accounted for respectively 29 and 26\% of the total variation in maturation rates and respectively 17 and 11\% of the variation in survival rates. Explaining the between-year differences in maturation rates with annual past rainfall or density did not improve the model fit. On the other hand we showed that maturation rates were correlated negatively with density the previous month and positively to cumulative rainfall over the past three months. Survival estimates of both adults and subadults varied seasonally, with higher estimates during the increase phase (dry season). The subadults were characterised by a very high survival rate ({\textgreater} 0.95) during this phase. In the decrease phase only minor differences were found between survival rates of subadults and adults. We found that 39\% of the between-year variation in survival can be explained by accumulated rainfall over the past year.},

Despite increased awareness, to date only a single case of Lassa fever has been confirmed in Mali. We conducted a survey to determine the prevalence of LASV exposure among persons in 3 villages in southern Mali where the presence of infected rodents has been documented. LASV IgG seroprevalence ranged from 14.5\% to 44\% per village. No sex bias was noted; however, seropositivity rates increased with participant age.

	abstract = {Genetic studies have typically inferred the effects of human impact by documenting patterns of genetic differentiation and levels of genetic diversity among potentially isolated populations using selective neutral markers such as mitochondrial control region sequences, microsatellites or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs). However, evolutionary relevant and adaptive processes within and between populations can only be reflected by coding genes. In vertebrates, growing evidence suggests that genetic diversity is particularly important at the level of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHC variants influence many important biological traits, including immune recognition, susceptibility to infectious and autoimmune diseases, individual odours, mating preferences, kin recognition, cooperation and pregnancy outcome. These diverse functions and characteristics place genes of the MHC among the best candidates for studies of mechanisms and significance of molecular adaptation in vertebrates. MHC variability is believed to be maintained by pathogen-driven selection, mediated either through heterozygote advantage or frequency-dependent selection. Up to now, most of our knowledge has derived from studies in humans or from model organisms under experimental, laboratory conditions. Empirical support for selective mechanisms in free-ranging animal populations in their natural environment is rare. In this review, I first introduce general information about the structure and function of MHC genes, as well as current hypotheses and concepts concerning the role of selection in the maintenance of MHC polymorphism. The evolutionary forces acting on the genetic diversity in coding and non-coding markers are compared. Then, I summarise empirical support for the functional importance of MHC variability in parasite resistance with emphasis on the evidence derived from free-ranging animal populations investigated in their natural habitat. Finally, I discuss the importance of adaptive genetic variability with respect to human impact and conservation, and implications for future studies.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the impact of man-made conflict events and climate change impact in guiding evidence-based community "One Health" epidemiology and emergency response practice against re-/emerging epidemics. Increasing evidence of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases including recent Lassa fever outbreaks in almost 20 states in Nigeria led to 101 deaths and 175 suspected and confirmed cases since August 2015. Of the 75 laboratory confirmed cases, 90 deaths occurred representing 120\% laboratory-confirmed case fatality. The outbreak has been imported into neighbouring country such as Benin, where 23 deaths out of 68 cases has also been reported. This study assesses the current trends in re-emerging Lassa fever outbreak in understanding spatio-geographical reservoir(s), risk factors pattern and Lassa virus incidence mapping, inherent gaps and raising challenges in health systems. It is shown that Lassa fever peak endemicity incidence and prevalence overlap the dry season (within January to March) and reduced during the wet season (of May to November) annually in Sierra Leone, Senegal to Eastern Nigeria. We documented a scarcity of consistent data on rodent (reservoirs)-linked Lassa fever outbreak, weak culturally and socio-behavioural effective prevention and control measures integration, weak or limited community knowledge and awareness to inadequate preparedness capacity and access to affordable case management in affected countries. Hence, robust sub/regional leadership commitment and investment in Lassa fever is urgently needed in building integrated and effective community "One Health" surveillance and rapid response approach practice coupled with pest management and phytosanitation measures against Lassa fever epidemic. This offers new opportunities in understanding human-animal interactions in strengthening Lassa fever outbreak early detection and surveillance, warning alerts and rapid response implementation in vulnerable settings. Leveraging on Africa CDC centre, advances in cloud-sourcing and social media tools and solutions is core in developing and integrating evidence-based and timely risk communication, and reporting systems in improving contextual community-based immunization and control decision making policy to effectively defeat Lassa fever outbreak and other emerging pandemics public health emergencies in Africa and worldwide.},

In the monkeys, early viral lymphoreticulotropism, hepatotropism, nephrotropism, and viraemia were noted. At the time of death, viral titres in nearly all target organs were associated with necrotic changes: splenic lymphoid necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, myocarditis, arteritis, and hepatocytic regeneration. In convalescent monkeys, organ titres diminished slowly, and viraemia persisted at 28 days. At this time, renal and splenic regeneration was occurring and a new lesion, choriomeningitis, was present., Guinea-pigs infected with Lassa virus developed respiratory insufficiency with pulmonary oedema, alveolar hyaline membranes, myocarditis, and focal calcification of myocardial fibres and hepatocytes. Dying animals contained Lassa virus in virtually every organ tested, whereas survivors at 56 days were free of virus and had high complement-fixing antibody titres., Infection of neonatal Mastomys did not cause any clinical disease or pathological lesions despite the presence of virus in the blood, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, lung, brain, urine, and throat secretions throughout the 74-day study. Infected adult Mastomys also remained normal but had virus in many organs. In one animal, virus persisted until the termination of the study at 103 days. Several animals developed a mild meningoencephalitis. The pattern of infection and virus shedding in M. natalensis is ideal for maintenance of the virus in nature; together with the epidemiological field data this emphasizes the incidental nature of the exposure and infection of man.},

A high level of diversity exists between the Liberian Lassa virus genomes. Nucleotide percent difference between Liberian Lassa virus genomes ranged up to 27\% in the L segment and 18\% in the S segment.

Eight Lassa virus strains were isolated from tissues and blood of rodents identified in the field as being of 3 different species: Mastomys natalensis, Rattus rattus, and Mus minutoides. All the infected rodents were collected in village habitats. These isolations indicate the presence of Lassa virus in wild rodents in Nigeria during periods when no human infections were evident., Prior studies in Sierra Leone have indicated that a single rodent species, M. natalensis, may be the important reservoir host of Lassa virus. Since the present study indicates that other rodent species may be involved as well, the ecology of Lassa virus may be more complicated than was heretofore supposed. In view of the importance of determining the geographic and species range of rodent hosts of Lassa virus, and because of the problems inherent in rodent identification under austere field conditions, it is urgent that further studies be conducted in the same areas of Nigeria to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {Accurate data on the Lassa virus (LASV) human case fatality rate (CFR) and the prevalence of LASV in humans, rodents and other mammals are needed for better planning of actions that will ultimately reduce the burden of LASV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. In this systematic review with meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Africa Journal Online, and African Index Medicus from 1969 to 2020 to obtain studies that reported enough data to calculate LASV infection CFR or prevalence. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently. We extracted all measures of current, recent, and past infections with LASV. Prevalence and CFR estimates were pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis. Factors associated with CFR, prevalence, and sources of between-study heterogeneity were determined using subgroup and metaregression analyses. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020166465. We initially identified 1,399 records and finally retained 109 reports that contributed to 291 prevalence records from 25 countries. The overall CFR was 29.7\% (22.3–37.5) in humans. Pooled prevalence of LASV infection was 8.7\% (95\% confidence interval: 6.8–10.8) in humans, 3.2\% (1.9–4.6) in rodents, and 0.7\% (0.0–2.3) in other mammals. Subgroup and metaregression analyses revealed a substantial statistical heterogeneity explained by higher prevalence in tissue organs, in case-control, in hospital outbreak, and surveys, in retrospective studies, in urban and hospital setting, in hospitalized patients, and in West African countries. This study suggests that LASV infections is an important cause of death in humans and that LASV are common in humans, rodents and other mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. These estimates highlight disparities between sub-regions, and population risk profiles. Western Africa, and specific key populations were identified as having higher LASV CFR and prevalence, hence, deserving more attention for cost-effective preventive interventions.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever, caused by an arenavirus discovered in 1969 in Nigeria. Nosocomial outbreaks and high seroprevalences have been recorded in Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. After 7–10 days of incubation, humans develop fever, malaise, headache, myalgias and sore throat, although most have no recognized symptoms. Acute cases with diarrhea, edema and bleeding from mucosal surfaces affect 0.5\% of the human population, with death occurring 10–15 days after onset. The disease has two geographically endemic areas separated by 2000 km with little evidence of virus circulation in Benin, Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire and Mali. The reservoir is the multimammate mouse, Mastomys natalensis, a rodent widely distributed in Africa. In West Africa, this species is mainly commensal, with populations fluctuating over time and space in rural localities. They are more abundant inside human habitation during the dry season than during the rainy season, increasing the risk of transmission to humans in the dry season. People living in villages are infected by contact with rodent excreta, or by inhaling viral particles. There is also evidence of human-to-human transmission in rural and urban localities. A human-to-rodent transmission is also discussed in this chapter as a consequence of the virus excretion in human saliva and urine, and the virus surviving outside the host. The genome of Lassa virus is bisegmented, with a small fragment coding for the glycoprotein and the nucleoprotein, and a long segment coding for the polymerase and the matrix protein. Today, 11 strains are completely sequenced, and phylogenies reveal large virus diversity in Nigeria with three lineages, while only one exists in Sierra Leone-Guinea-Liberia. Another lineage from Ghana-Côte d’Ivoire-Mali would be intermediate. The phylogeny reveals that Lassa virus emerged 700–900 years ago in Nigeria and then in Sierra Leone 150–200 years ago. This time scale does not support the co-evolution concept since M. natalensis emerged 2.3 million years ago. Recent findings such as new arenaviruses in other African rodents and in snakes argue preferably toward the host-switching concept. The recent emergence in Sierra Leone, the absence of virus positive Mastomys between the two endemic zones and poor virus diversity in the Mano River area point in the direction of a unique import of Lassa virus from Nigeria to Sierra Leone during the 19th century. The hypothesis of human displacements through the Atlantic slave trade and its abolition in 1807 concludes this chapter.},

Here, we compare prevalence of Yersinia pestis, the etiologic agent of plague, in rodents across two land-use types—agricultural and conserved—in northern Tanzania. Estimated abundance of seropositive rodents nearly doubled in agricultural sites compared with conserved sites. This relationship between land-use type and abundance of seropositive rodents is likely mediated by changes in rodent and flea community composition, particularly via an increase in the abundance of the commensal species, Mastomys natalensis, in agricultural habitats. There was mixed support for rodent species diversity negatively impacting Y. pestis seroprevalence. Together, these results suggest that land-use change could affect the risk of local transmission of plague, and raise critical questions about transmission dynamics at the interface of conserved and agricultural habitats. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding disease ecology in the context of rapidly proceeding landscape change.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT. The influence of the intensity of land use on small mammals in the ecoregion Nama Karoo, Namibia was investigated within the biodiversity programme BIOTA. Changes in species diversity and abundance were investigated across a fence separating heavily grazed communal and lightly grazed government owned rangeland. Assessing and monitoring of the small mammal populations were done seasonally from 2001-2003 on each of 2ha plots by using capture-mark-recapture methods. In total, 311 individuals representing nine species were caught within 5760 trap nights. Species richness, total abundance, species diversity and settlement was lower in the over-grazed area. The most abundant species were the Gerbillinae, Gerbillurus vallinus and Tatera leucogaster. T. leu-cogaster did not occur in the overgrazed area. Due to the loss of grass cover, smaller bush diversity, bush encroach-ment and smaller arthropod abundance in the overgrazed area, changes in the small mammal community were most likely caused by the loss of food resources, available dew, disruption of habitat structures, cover and shelter and by increased predation risk. Only the ‘desert ’ species, G. vallinus, was favoured by the degraded land. It is also obvious that the uncontrolled grazing in the communal lands has affected the biodiversity and the regeneration potential, thus leading to land degradation.},

A total of 1,030 rodents belonging to 14 species were captured on 10,584 trap nights. Rodent species recorded include: Lophuromys stanleyi, Hylomyscus stella, Praomys jacksoni, Mastomys natalensis, Lophuromys ansorgei, Lemniscomys striatus, Aethomys hindei, Mus triton, Mus minutoides, Deomys ferrugineus, Gerbilliscus kempi, Rattus rattus, Grammomys kuru, and Hybomys univittatus. Overall, L. stanleyi (23.7\%) was the most dominant species followed by H. stella, P. jacksoni, and M. natalensis. Species richness and evenness was highest in the regenerating forest habitat and least in the intact forest habitat. Rodent abundance was significantly affected by habitat type. The regenerating forest habitat had the highest number of animals, while the lowest numbers were observed in the depleted forest habitat. Species diversity was higher in regenerating forest habitat and lowest in the intact forest. The three habitats appeared distinct in terms of rodent species composition and there was a strong association between the two trapping grids in the same habitat type. All ordination plots showed that different rodent species consistently associated with distinct habitats. Habitat type and seasonal changes influenced rodent composition, relative abundance and habitat association. Composition of rodent community reflected the level of habitat degradation and can be used as a proxy for evaluating the biodiversity of lowland tropical forests.},

	abstract = {Cropping is responsible for substantial emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHGs) worldwide through the use of fertilizers and through expansion of agricultural land and associated carbon losses. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), GHG emissions from these processes might increase steeply in coming decades, due to tripling demand for food until 2050 to match the steep population growth. This study assesses the impact of achieving cereal self-sufficiency by the year 2050 for 10 SSA countries on GHG emissions related to different scenarios of increasing cereal production, ranging from intensifying production to agricultural area expansion. We also assessed different nutrient management variants in the intensification. Our analysis revealed that irrespective of intensification or extensification, GHG emissions of the 10 countries jointly are at least 50\% higher in 2050 than in 2015. Intensification will come, depending on the nutrient use efficiency achieved, with large increases in nutrient inputs and associated GHG emissions. However, matching food demand through conversion of forest and grasslands to cereal area likely results in much higher GHG emissions. Moreover, many countries lack enough suitable land for cereal expansion to match food demand. In addition, we analysed the uncertainty in our GHG estimates and found that it is caused primarily by uncertainty in the IPCC Tier 1 coefficient for direct N2O emissions, and by the agronomic nitrogen use efficiency (N-AE). In conclusion, intensification scenarios are clearly superior to expansion scenarios in terms of climate change mitigation, but only if current N-AE is increased to levels commonly achieved in, for example, the United States, and which have been demonstrated to be feasible in some locations in SSA. As such, intensifying cereal production with good agronomy and nutrient management is essential to moderate inevitable increases in GHG emissions. Sustainably increasing crop production in SSA is therefore a daunting challenge in the coming decades.},

	abstract = {Background
            : The uncontrolled inflammatory response plays a critical role in the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) is thought to be intricate to inflammatory signal amplification. This study aims to investigate the association between soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) and COVID-19 as a prognostic biomarker to predict the disease severity, lethality and clinical management.
            Methods
            : We enrolled 91 patients with COVID-19 in domiciliary care (44 patients) or in hospital care (47 patients), who were classified after admission into mild, moderate, severe and critical groups according to their clinical scores. As non-COVID-19 control, 30 healthy volunteers were included. Data on demographic, comorbidities and baseline clinical characteristics were obtained from their medical and nurse records. Peripheral blood samples were collected at admission and after hospitalization outcome to assess cytokine profile and sTREM-1 level by specific immunoassays
            Results
            : Within COVID-19 patients, the highest severity was associated with the most significant elevated plasma levels sTREM-1. Using receiver operating curve analysis (ROC), sTREM-1 was found to be predictive of disease severity (AUC= 0.988) and the best cut-off value for predicting in-hospital severity was ≥ 116.5 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 93.3\% and specificity for 95.8\%. We also described the clinical characteristics of these patients and explored the correlation with markers of the disease aggravation. The levels of sTREM-1 were positively correlated with IL-6, IL-10, blood neutrophils counts, and critical disease scoring (r= 0.68, p{\textless}0.0001). On the other hand, sTREM-1 level was significantly negative correlated with lymphocytes counting, and mild disease (r= -0.42, p{\textless}0.0001). Higher levels of sTREM-1 were related to poor outcome and death, patients who received dexamethasone tended to have lower sTREM-1 levels.
            Conclusion
            : Our results indicated that sTREM-1 in COVID-19 is associated with severe disease development and a prognostic marker for mortality. The use of severity biomarkers such as sTREM-1 together with patients clinical scores could improve the early recognition and monitoring of COVID-19 cases with higher risk of disease worsening.

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate antihypertensive medications and COVID-19 diagnosis and mortality, accounting for healthcare seeking behaviour. Design: A population-based case control study with additional cohort analysis. Setting: Primary care patients from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Participants: 16 866 patients with COVID-19 events in the CPRD from 29th January to June 25th 2020 and 70 137 matched controls. Main outcome measures: We explored associations between COVID-19 diagnosis and prescriptions for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (B), calcium-channel blockers (C), thiazide diuretics (D) and other antihypertensive drugs (O). We evaluated all-cause mortality among COVID-19 cases. Analyses were adjusted for covariates and consultation frequency.
Results: In covariate adjusted analyses, ACEIs were associated with lower odds of COVID19 diagnosis (0.82, 95\% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.88) as were ARBs, 0.87 (0.80 to 0.95) with little attenuation from adjustment for consultation frequency. In fully adjusted analyses, C and D were also associated with lower odds of COVID-19. Increased odds of COVID-19 for B (1.19, 1.12 to 1.26), were attenuated after adjustment for consultation frequency (1.01, 0.95 to 1.08). In adjusted analyses, patients treated with ACEIs or ARBs had similar mortality to patients treated with classes B, C, D or O (1.00, 0.83 to 1.20) or patients receiving no antihypertensive therapy (0.99, 0.83 to 1.18).
Conclusions: Associations were sensitive to adjustment for confounding and healthcare seeking, but there was no evidence that antihypertensive therapy is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis or mortality; most classes of antihypertensive therapy showed negative associations with COVID-19 diagnosis.},

METHODS This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. From February 5, 2020 to March 4, 2020, 98 consecutive patients classified as critical COVID-19 were included in Huo Shen Shan Hospital. The final date of follow-up was March 29, 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death.
RESULTS Of the 98 patients, 43 (43.9\%) died in hospital, 37(37.8\%) discharged, and 18(18.4\%) remained in hospital. The mean age was 68.5 (63, 75) years, and 57 (58.2\%) were female. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (68.4\%), followed by diabetes (17.3\%), angina pectoris (13.3\%). Except the sex (Female: 68.8\% vs 49.1\%, P=0.039) and angina pectoris (20.9\% vs 7.3\%, P = 0.048), there was no difference in other demographics and comorbidities between non-survivor and survivor groups. The proportion of elevated alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, D-dimer and cardiac injury marker were 59.4\%, 35.7\%, 87.5\% and 42.9\%, respectively, and all showed the significant difference between two groups. The acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury (AKI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were observed in 42.9\%, 27.8\% and 26.5\% of the patients. Compared with survivor group, non-survivor group had more acute cardiac injury (79.1\% vs 14.5\%, P{\textless}0.0001), AKI (50.0\% vs 10.9\%, P{\textless}0.0001), and ARDS (37.2\% vs 18.2\%, P=0.034). Multivariable Cox regression showed increasing hazard ratio of in-hospital death associated with acute cardiac injury (HR, 6.57 [95\% CI, 1.89-22.79]) and AKI (HR, 2.60 [95\% CI, 1.15-5.86]).  
CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 classified as critical type had a high prevalence of acute cardiac and kidney injury, which were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.},

	abstract = {Objective: The evidence pertaining to the effects of asthma on Coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes has been unclear. To improve our understanding of the clinically important association of asthma and Coronavirus disease 2019.
Methods: A matched cohort study was performed using data from the Mass General Brigham Health Care System (Boston, MA). Adult (age ≥ 18 years) patients with confirmed Coronavirus disease 2019 and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or interstitial lung disease between March 4, 2020 and July 2, 2020 were analyzed. Up to 5 non-asthma comparators were matched to each asthma patient based on age (within 5 years), sex, and date of positive test (within 7 days). The primary outcomes were hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death, using multivariable Cox-proportional hazards models accounting for competing risk of death, when appropriate. Patients were followed for these outcomes from diagnosis of Coronavirus disease 2019 until July 2, 2020.
Results: Among 562 asthma patients, 199 (21\%) were hospitalized, 15 (3\%) received mechanical ventilation, and 7 (1\%) died. Among the 2686 matched comparators, 487 (18\%) were hospitalized, 107 (4\%) received mechanical ventilation, and 69 (3\%) died. The adjusted Hazard Ratios among asthma patients were 0.99 (95\% Confidence Internal 0.80, 1.22) for hospitalization, 0.69 (95\% Confidence Internal 0.36, 1.29) for mechanical ventilation, and 0.30 (95\% Confidence Internal 0.11, 0.80) for death.
Conclusions: In this matched cohort study from a large Boston-based healthcare system, asthma was associated with comparable risk of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation but a lower risk of mortality.},

            Background
            Hospital staff are at high risk of infection during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We analysed the exposure characteristics, efficacy of protective measures, and transmission dynamics in this hospital-wide prospective seroprevalence study.
          
          
            Methods and Findings
            Overall, 4554 individuals were tested for anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibodies using a chemiluminescent immunoassay. Individual risk factors, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), occupational exposure, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire and correlated to anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titres and PCR testing results. Odds ratios with corresponding exact 95\% confidence intervals were used to evaluate associations between individual factors and seropositivity. Spatio-temporal trajectories of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and staff mobility within the hospital were visualised to identify local hotspots of virus transmission.
            The overall seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibody was 2.4\% [95\% CI 1.9–2.9]. Patient-facing staff, including those working in COVID-19 areas, had a similar probability of being seropositive as non-patient-facing staff. Prior interaction with SARS-CoV-2-infected co-workers or private contacts and unprotected exposure to COVID-19 patients increased the probability of seropositivity. Loss of smell and taste had the highest positive predictive value for seropositivity. The rate of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections was 25.9\%, and higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titres were observed in symptomatic individuals. Spatio-temporal hotspots of SARS-CoV-2-positive staff and patients only showed partial overlap.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Patient-facing work in a healthcare facility during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may be safe if adequate PPE and hygiene measures are applied. The high numbers of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections that escaped detection by symptomatic testing underline the value of cross-sectional seroprevalence studies. Unprotected contact is a major risk factor for infection and argues for the rigorous implementation of hygiene measures.},

	abstract = {Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pneumonia is often associated with hyperinflammation. Safety and efficacy of the anti–interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab was evaluated in patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia.
Methods: Nonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia were randomized (2:1) to tocilizumab (8 mg/kg intravenous) or placebo plus standard care. Sites enrolling high-risk and minority populations were emphasized. The primary endpoint was cumulative proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28.
Results: Of 389 randomized patients, 249 patients received tocilizumab and 128 received placebo in the modified intent-to-treat population (Hispanic/Latino, 56.0\%; Black/African American, 14.9\%; American Indian/Alaska Native, 12.7\%; White, 12.7\%; other/unknown, 3.7\%). The cumulative proportion (95\% confidence interval [CI]) of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or who had died by Day 28 was 12.0\% (8.52\% to 16.86\%) and 19.3 \% (13.34\% to 27.36\%) for the tocilizumab and placebo arms, respectively (log-rank P=0.0360; hazard ratio, 0.56 [95\% CI, 0.33 to 0.97]). Median time to clinical failure up to Day 28 favored tocilizumab over placebo (hazard ratio 0.55 [95\% CI, 0.33 to 0.93]). All-cause mortality by Day 28 was 10.4\% with tocilizumab and 8.6\% with placebo (weighted difference, 2.0\% [95\% CI, –5.2\% to 7.8\%). In the safety population, serious adverse events occurred in 15.2\% of tocilizumab patients (38/250 patients) and 19.7\% of placebo patients (25/127).
Conclusions: This trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab over placebo in reducing the likelihood of progression to requiring mechanical ventilation or death in nonventilated patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia.},

Methods: Outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients with concurrent HIV (PLH) were compared with a propensity-matched cohort of patients without HIV (non-PLH).
Results: Fifty thousand one hundred and sixty-seven patients with COVID-19 were identiﬁed (49,763 non-PLH, 404 PLH). PLH were more likely to be men, African–American, obese and have concurrent hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and nicotine dependence compared with non-PLH cohort (all P values {\textless}0.05). We performed 1 : 1 matching for BMI, diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung diseases, chronic kidney disease, race, history of nicotine dependence and sex. In unmatched analysis, PLH had higher mortality at 30 days [risk ratio 1.55, 95\% conﬁdence interval (95\% CI): 1.01–2.39] and were more likely to need inpatient services (risk ratio 1.83, 95\% CI: 1.496–2.24). After propensity score matching, no difference in mortality was noted (risk ratio 1.33, 95\% CI: 0.69–2.57). A higher proportion of PLH group needed inpatient services (19.31 vs. 11.39\%, risk ratio 1.696, 95\% CI: 1.21–2.38). Mean Creactive protein, ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase levels after COVID-19 diagnosis were not statistically different and mortality was not different for PLH with a history of antiretroviral treatment.
Conclusion: Crude COVID-19 mortality is higher in PLH; however, propensitymatched analyses revealed no difference in outcomes, showing that higher mortality is driven by higher burden of comorbidities. Early diagnosis and intensive surveillance are needed to prevent a ‘Syndemic’ of diseases in this vulnerable cohort.},

	abstract = {Background: The role of combination immunomodulatory therapy with systemic corticosteroids and tocilizumab (TCZ) for aged patients with COVID19 associated cytokine release syndrome remains unclear.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective single center study including consecutive patients older than 65 years that developed severe COVID19 between March 3 and May 1, 2020 and were treated with corticosteroids at various doses (methylprednisolone [0.5 mg/Kg/12 hours to 250 mg/24 hours]), either alone (CS group) or associated to intravenous tocilizumab (400 to 600 mg, one to three doses) (CS/TCZ group). Primary outcome was all cause mortality by day +14, whereas secondary outcomes included mortality by day +28 and clinical improvement (discharge and/or a 2 point decrease on a six point ordinal scale) by day +14. Propensity score (PS)based adjustment and inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) were applied.
Results: Overall, 181 and 80 patients were included in the CS and CS TCZ groups. All cause 14 day mortality was lower in the CS/TCZ group, both in the PS adjusted (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.34; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17 to 0.68; P value = 0.002) and IPTW weighted models (odds ratio [OR]: 0.38; 95\% CI: 0.21 to 0.68; P value = 0.001). This protective effect was also observed for 28 day mortality (PS adjusted HR: 0.38; 95\% CI: 0.21 to 0.72; P value = 0.003). Clinical improvement by day +14 was higher in the CS/TCZ group in the IPTW analysis only (OR: 2.26; 95\% CI: 1.49 to 3.41; P value {\textless}0.001). The occurrence of secondary infection was similar between both groups.
Conclusions: The combination of corticosteroids and TCZ was associated with better outcomes among patients older than 65 years with severe COVID-19.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium) partnerships and outbreak preparedness initiatives enabled the rapid launch of standardised clinical data collection on COVID-19 in Jan 2020. Extensive global uptake of this resource has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. This report is a part of a series and includes the results of data analysis on 4 October 2020. We thank all of the data contributors for their ongoing support. Report highlights include: ISARIC collaborators recorded symptoms from over 102,000 patients in hospital with COVID-19. Most had fever, cough or shortness of breath. Children and older adults were less likely to display typical symptoms, and over 40\% of patients \&gt;80 years experienced confusion. The ISARIC international database continues to grow. Data have been entered for 102,959 individuals from 566 sites across 42 countries. The analysis detailed in this report only includes individuals: 1. for whom data collection commenced on or before 14 September 2020. AND 2. who have laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed SARS-COV-2 infection. For the 88,463 cases who meet eligibility criteria for this report: o The median age is 72 years. o A total of 18\% of patients were admitted at some point during their illness into an intensive care unit. o Antibiotic use is high (82.2\% of patients received antibiotics - the choice of antibiotic and specific indication have not yet been determined.) o Fever, shortness of breath, a non-productive cough and fatigue were the most common symptoms. o Altered consciousness/confusion was also relatively frequent (19,619/86,175) and most common in elderly patients. Overall, elderly patients are less likely to present with URTI symptoms.

The remaining 401 specimens comprised twelve species. Weights, measurements and reproductive details were taken of each specimen. The distribution of larger rodents not caught in traps, but exposed as a result of bulldozed clearance of their habitat is discussed. The removal of high forest and its replacement by agriculture and domestic housing increased the numbers, biomass and diversity of small rodents. Seasonal changes in trap success were noted, but the patterns differed from one habitat to another. In general, more rodents were trapped during the rains of the second quarter than during the dry months of the first quarter of the year. Seasonal changes in the breeding of two rodent species were also noted although they differed from each other, and speculations on the reasons why the rodent population varied from habitat to habitat are discussed.},

We use mechanistic modelling to study the Lassa fever epidemics in Nigeria from 2016-19. Our model describes the interaction between human and rodent populations with the consideration of quarantine, isolation and hospitalization processes. Our model supports the phenomenon of forward bifurcation where the stability between disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium exchanges. Moreover, our model captures well the incidence curves from surveillance data. In particular, our model is able to reconstruct the periodic rodent and human forces of infection. Furthermore, we suggest that the three major epidemics from 2016-19 can be modelled by properly characterizing the rodent (or human) force of infection while the estimated human force of infection also present similar patterns across outbreaks. Our results suggest that the initial susceptibility likely increased across the three outbreaks from 2016-19.

	abstract = {Lassa virus is a significant burden on human health throughout its endemic region in West Africa, with most human infections the result of spillover from the primary rodent reservoir of the virus, the natal multimammate mouse, M. natalensis. Here we develop a Bayesian methodology for estimating epidemiological parameters of Lassa virus within its rodent reservoir and for generating probabilistic predictions for the efficacy of rodent vaccination programs. Our approach uses Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to integrate mechanistic mathematical models, remotely-sensed precipitation data, and Lassa virus surveillance data from rodent populations. Using simulated data, we show that our method accurately estimates key model parameters, even when surveillance data are available from only a relatively small number of points in space and time. Applying our method to previously published data from two villages in Guinea estimates the time-averaged R0 of Lassa virus to be 1.74 and 1.54 for rodent populations in the villages of Bantou and Tanganya, respectively. Using the posterior distribution for model parameters derived from these Guinean populations, we evaluate the likely efficacy of vaccination programs relying on distribution of vaccine-laced baits. Our results demonstrate that effective and durable reductions in the risk of Lassa virus spillover into the human population will require repeated distribution of large quantities of vaccine.},

	abstract = {The fluctuations in abundance of a wildlife reservoir are an attractive explanation for temporal variation in primary human cases of a zoonosis. This is because high abundance may lead to more contact between humans and animals, but also to outbreaks of disease within the reservoir population. We propose a mathematical framework that sets out the consequences of correlation between reservoir abundance and reservoir prevalence for how numbers of human cases are related to reservoir abundance. The fluctuations of rodent populations are well studied and often dramatic. A review of field studies of rodent reservoirs for plague, hantaviruses, and other zoonoses shows that, at a seasonal time scale, a positive correlation between host abundance and host prevalence is rarely observed. More commonly, there is an inverse relationship or negative correlation such that a seasonal increase in rodent abundance is not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the abundance of infectious animals. Seasonal changes in rodent abundance are hence unlikely to fully explain seasonal variation in primary human cases. The few longer field studies (Ͼ5 years) show a positive but delayed relationship between reservoir abundance and reservoir prevalence. Key Words: Force of infection—Hantavirus—Plague.

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Objectives
            Recent reports suggest a high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in COVID-19 patients, but the role of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in the clinical course of COVID-19 is unknown. We evaluated the time-to-event relationship between hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and COVID-19 outcomes.
          
          
            Design
            We analyzed data from the prospective Dutch COVID-PREDICT cohort, an ongoing prospective study of patients admitted for COVID-19 infection.
          
          
            Setting
            Patients from 8 participating hospitals, including two university hospitals from the COVID-PREDICT cohort were included.
          
          
            Participants
            Admitted, adult patients with a positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or high suspicion based on CT-imaging of the thorax. Patients were followed for major outcomes during hospitalization. CVD risk factors were established via home medication lists and divided in antihypertensives, lipid lowering therapy, and antidiabetics.
          
          
            Primary and secondary outcomes measures
            The primary outcome was mortality during the first 21 days following admission, secondary outcomes consisted of ICU-admission and ICU-mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression analyses were used to determine the association with CVD risk factors.
          
          
            Results
            We included 1604 patients with a mean age of 66±15 of whom 60.5\% were men. Antihypertensives, lipid lowering therapy, and antidiabetics were used by 45\%, 34.7\%, and 22.1\% of patients. After adjustment for age and sex, the presence of ≥2 risk factors was associated with increased mortality risk (HR 1.52, 95\%CI 1.15-2.02), but not with ICU-admission. Moreover, the use of ≥2 antidiabetics and ≥2 antihypertensives was associated with mortality independent of age and sex with HRs of respectively 2.09 (95\%CI 1.55-2.80) and 1.46 (95\%CI 1.11-1.91).
          
          
            Conclusions
            The accumulation of hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes leads to a stepwise increased risk for short-term mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients independent of age and sex. Further studies investigating how these risk factors disproportionately affect COVID-19 patients are warranted.
          
          
            Strengths and limitations of this study
            
              
                While previous data reported a high prevalence of CVD risk factors in COVID-19 patients, this study investigated whether diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension predict adverse outcomes.
              
              
                This study is limited by the use of medication as surrogate for cardiovascular risk factors
              
              
                The causality of the investigated risk factors remains to be addressed in future studies.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Introduction There is limited data on clinical course and outcomes of hospitalized adults with COVID-19 in Nepal. Thus, it is imperative to characterize the features of this disease in the domestic context. Methodology We identified all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to five different hospitals in Nepal from June 15 to July 15, 2020. We collected epidemiological, socio-cultural and clinicopathologic data, and stratified the patients based on their symptom status. Results The study included 220 patients with an overall median age of 31.5 (25-37) years, and 181 (82.3\%) were males. 159 (72.3\%) were asymptomatic, and 163 (74.1\%) were imported cases. Of 217 patients with the available data, 110 (50.7\%) reported their annual household income less than 2000 US dollars, and 122 (56.2\%) practiced Pranayama (yogic rhythmic breathing techniques) regularly. Eight patients (3.6\%) required supplemental oxygen and two patients (0.9\%) died. None of the patients who practiced Pranayama regularly required supplemental oxygen. Compared to asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients had greater proportion of females (31.1\% vs. 12.6\%, p=0.001), imported cases (85.2\% vs. 69.8\%, p=0.02), illiterates (26.8\% vs. 12.1\%, p=0.01), alcohol users (43.3\% vs. 24.5\%, p=0.01), patients feeling stigmatized by society (45.8\% vs. 22.6\%, p=0.001), and had higher platelet count (253 x 10{\textasciicircum}9/L vs. 185 x10{\textasciicircum}9/L, p=0.02). Conclusions Most cases were imported, asymptomatic young males, with very few deaths. Pranayama practice was associated with protection against severe COVID-19, but more data is needed to substantiate this. The association of platelets count with symptom status in the Nepalese population needs further exploration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND It may take months to years until drugs specifically designed to treat COVID-19 are available. Until then, it is crucial to identify whether existing medications could have a protective effect against severe disease. This is the objective of this large population study performed in Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest healthcare provider in Israel. METHODS CHS centrally manages electronic health records (EHRs) including medication purchases for over 4.5 million members. Two case-control matched cohorts were assembled to assess systematically which drugs affected the risk of COVID 19 hospitalization: in both cohorts, case patients were hospitalized for COVID-19; matched control patients were taken from the general population in the first cohort, and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in the second cohort. For each medication anatomical-therapeutic-chemical (ATC) class acquired during the last month before the index-date, we computed the odds ratio (OR) for hospitalization, 95\% confidence interval (CI), and the p value, using Fisher9s exact test. False discovery rate was used to adjust for multiple testing. RESULTS Several drugs and pharmacy sold items were associated with significantly reduced odds for SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization, notably ubiquinone (OR=0.185, 95\% CI [0.058,0.458], p\&lt;0.001), ezetimibe (OR=0.513, 95\% CI [0.375,0.688], P\&lt;0.001), rosuvastatin (OR=0.746, 95\% CI [0.645,0.858], p\&lt;0.001) and flecainide (OR=0.303, 95\% CI [0.080,0.813], p\&lt;0.01). Additionally, acquisition of surgical masks, latex gloves and several ophthalmological products were associated with decreased risk for hospitalization. CONCLUSION Ubiquinone, ezetimibe and rosuvastatin, all related to the cholesterol synthesis pathway were associated with reduced hospitalization risk. These findings suggest a promising protective effect which should be further investigated.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Mortality attributable to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) 2 infection occurs mainly through the development of viral pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Research Question: The objective of the study is to delineate the clinical profile, predictors of disease progression, and 30-day mortality from ARDS using the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse. Study Design and Methods: Analysis of a historical cohort of 7,816 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection between January 1, 2020, and August 1, 2020. Main outcomes were progression to ARDS and 30-day mortality from ARDS, respectively. Results: The cohort was comprised predominantly of men (94.5\%) with a median age of 69 years (interquartile range [IQR] 60-74 years). 2,184 (28\%) were admitted to the intensive care unit and 643 (29.4\%) were diagnosed with ARDS. The median Charlson Index was 3 (IQR 1-5). Independent predictors of progression to ARDS were body mass index (BMI)≥ 40 kg/m2, diabetes, lymphocyte counts\&lt;700x109/L, LDH\&gt;450 U/L, ferritin \&gt;862 ng/ml, C-reactive protein \&gt;11 mg/dL, and D-dimer \&gt;1.5 ug/ml. In contrast, the use of an anticoagulant lowered the risk of developing ARDS (OR 0.66 [95\% CI 0.49-0.89]. Crude 30-day mortality rate from ARDS was 41\% (95\% CI 38\%-45\%). Risk of death from ARDS was significantly higher in those who developed acute renal failure and septic shock. Use of an anticoagulant was associated with two-fold reduction in mortality. Survival benefit was observed in patients who received corticosteroids and/or remdesivir but there was no advantage of combination therapy over either agent alone. Conclusions: Among those hospitalized for COVID-19, nearly one in ten progressed to ARDS. Septic shock, and acute renal failure are the leading causes of death in these patients. Treatment with either remdesivir and corticosteroids reduced the risk of mortality from ARDS. All hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should be placed at a minimum on prophylactic doses of anticoagulation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background Loss of smell and taste are commonly reported symptoms associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in people with acute loss of smell and/or taste is unknown. The study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a community-based population with acute loss of smell and/or taste and to compare the frequency of COVID-19 associated symptoms in participants with and without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. It also evaluated whether smell or taste loss are indicative of COVID-19 infection. Methods and findings Text messages, sent via primary care centers in London, United Kingdom, invited people with loss of smell and/or taste in the preceding month, to participate. Recruitment took place between 23 April 2020 and 14 May 2020. A total of 590 participants enrolled via a web-based platform and responded to questions about loss of smell and taste and other COVID-19–related symptoms. Mean age was 39.4 years (SD ± 12.0) and 69.1\% (n = 392) of participants were female. A total of 567 (96.1\%) had a telemedicine consultation during which their COVID-19–related symptoms were verified and a lateral flow immunoassay test that detected SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies was undertaken under medical supervision. A total of 77.6\% of 567 participants with acute smell and/or taste loss had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; of these, 39.8\% (n = 175) had neither cough nor fever. New loss of smell was more prevalent in participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared with those without antibodies (93.4\% versus 78.7\%, p {\textless} 0.001), whereas taste loss was equally prevalent (90.2\% versus 89.0\%, p = 0.738). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was 3 times more likely in participants with smell loss (OR 2.86; 95\% CI 1.27–6.36; p {\textless} 0.001) compared with those with taste loss. The limitations of this study are the lack of a general population control group, the self-reported nature of the smell and taste changes, and the fact our methodology does not take into account the possibility that a population subset may not seroconvert to develop SARS-CoV-2 antibodies post-COVID-19. Conclusions Our findings suggest that recent loss of smell is a highly specific COVID-19 symptom and should be considered more generally in guiding case isolation, testing, and treatment of COVID-19.

	abstract = {Background There is disagreement about the level of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We conducted a living systematic review and meta-analysis to address three questions: (1) Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? (2) Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? (3) What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection or presymptomatic? Methods and findings We searched PubMed, Embase, bioRxiv, and medRxiv using a database of SARS-CoV-2 literature that is updated daily, on 25 March 2020, 20 April 2020, and 10 June 2020. Studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up or modelling studies were included. One reviewer extracted data and a second verified the extraction, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Risk of bias in empirical studies was assessed with an adapted checklist for case series, and the relevance and credibility of modelling studies were assessed using a published checklist. We included a total of 94 studies. The overall estimate of the proportion of people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and remain asymptomatic throughout infection was 20\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 17–25) with a prediction interval of 3\%–67\% in 79 studies that addressed this review question. There was some evidence that biases in the selection of participants influence the estimate. In seven studies of defined populations screened for SARS-CoV-2 and then followed, 31\% (95\% CI 26\%–37\%, prediction interval 24\%–38\%) remained asymptomatic. The proportion of people that is presymptomatic could not be summarised, owing to heterogeneity. The secondary attack rate was lower in contacts of people with asymptomatic infection than those with symptomatic infection (relative risk 0.35, 95\% CI 0.10–1.27). Modelling studies fit to data found a higher proportion of all SARS-CoV-2 infections resulting from transmission from presymptomatic individuals than from asymptomatic individuals. Limitations of the review include that most included studies were not designed to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were at risk of selection biases; we did not consider the possible impact of false negative RT-PCR results, which would underestimate the proportion of asymptomatic infections; and the database does not include all sources. Conclusions The findings of this living systematic review suggest that most people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 will not remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the infection. The contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention measures, with enhanced hand hygiene, masks, testing tracing, and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed.},

	abstract = {Background
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by an unpredictable disease course, ranging from asymptomatic to severe, life-threatening infections. Asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have been described, and the aim of this systematic review was to summarise their presentation forms.
Methods
We searched PubMed® and Google® (1 December 2019 to 29 March 2020) and extracted age, laboratory findings, and computed tomography (CT) scans. Pooled incidence rates of clinical characteristics were analyzed using random-effect models.
Results
In total, 506 patients from 34 studies (68 single cases and 438 from case-series) with an asymptomatic course were identified. Patients with normal radiology were younger (19.59 ± 17.17 years) than patients with abnormal radiology (39.14 ± 26.70 years) (p-value = 0.013). Despite being asymptomatic, CT investigations revealed abnormalities in 62.2\% of the cases; ground-glass opacities were most frequently observed (43.09\% by meta-analysis). Most studies reported normal laboratory findings (61.74\% by meta-analysis).
Conclusions
More than half of the patients without any symptoms present with CT abnormalities. Asymptomatic patients may be contagious and thus a potential source of transmission of COVID-19.},

Arenaviruses are pleomorphic enveloped particles that contain two RNA segments of virus origin and ribosome-like components. Suitable conditions for transmission of virus to humans occur in areas where humans come in contact with rodent urine that contains virus. Persistent viremia and viruria in rodents result from a slow or insufficient immune response when immunologically immature fetuses or neonates are infected. In humans, the disease is acute. There are five pathogens of humans, who are only accidental hosts. Four cause severe hemorrhagic fever with a mortality of about 15 percent among hospitalized patients in circumscribed areas (Lassa virus in West Africa, Junin virus in the Argentine pampas, Machupo virus in Bolivia, and Guanarito virus in Venezuela). The fifth, lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus, is much more widely distributed, but causes milder infections, often neurologic.

Though a rodent-borne infection, it can also be transmitted from person to person during the care of sick relations or more commonly in health care settings as a nosocomial infection. Vertical transmission from mother to child has been documented. We report 2 cases of LF among pregnant women which were managed at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, between September and October 2014. Both patients were in their early 20s with only one surviving the disease. Both had supportive therapy but none had antiviral therapy. This report emphasized the importance of early presentation, high index of suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and early commencement of supportive therapy in the management of patients suspected with LF especially in the era of other viral haemorrhagic infections.},

	abstract = {Arenaviruses are rodent-borne emerging human pathogens. Diseases caused by these viruses, e.g., Lassa fever (LF) in West Africa and South American hemorrhagic fevers (HFs), are serious public health problems in endemic areas. We have employed replication-competent and replication-deficient strategies to design vaccine candidates potentially targeting different groups "at risk". Our leader LF vaccine candidate, the live reassortant vaccine ML29, is safe and efficacious in all tested animal models including non-human primates. In this study we showed that treatment of fatally infected animals with ML29 two days after Lassa virus (LASV) challenge protected 80\% of the treated animals. In endemic areas, where most of the target population is poor and many live far from health care facilities, a single-dose vaccination with ML29 would be ideal solution. Once there is an outbreak, a fast-acting vaccine or post-exposure prophylaxis would be best. The 2(nd) vaccine technology is based on Yellow Fever (YF) 17D vaccine. We designed YF17D-based recombinant viruses expressing LASV glycoproteins (GP) and showed protective efficacy of these recombinants. In the current study we developed a novel technology to clone LASV nucleocapsid within YF17D C gene. Low immunogenicity and stability of foreign inserts must be addressed to design successful LASV/YFV bivalent vaccines to control LF and YF in overlapping endemic areas of West Africa. The 3(rd) platform is based on the new generation of alphavirus replicon virus-like-particle vectors (VLPV). Using this technology we designed VLPV expressing LASV GP with enhanced immunogenicity and bivalent VLPV expressing cross-reactive GP of Junin virus (JUNV) and Machupo virus (MACV), causative agents of Argentinian and Bolivian HF, respectively. A prime-boost regimen required for VLPV immunization might be practical for medical providers, military, lab personnel, and visitors in endemic areas.},

	abstract = {Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso, was recognized as a focus of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniosis in April 2000. Leishmania major was the only strain isolated in this focus. We conducted a prospective study to detect L. major in rodents, animals which are described as reservoir of the parasite. Rodents were caught in five city areas from November 2005 to October 2006. Giemsa stained smears were realized from the cutaneous lesions when present after macroscopic examination of external lesions. The spleen of each rodent was sterilely removed and split into 3 parts for microscopic examination of smears, culture on NNN media and PCR, respectively. A total of 101 rodents belonging to 9 genera were trapped. All the direct examinations and cultures were negative. By using PCR of lesions and spleen samples, three animals were found infected by L. major: one out of 24 (4.2\%) Mastomys natalensis; one out of 8 (12.5\%) Taterillus sp. and one out of three Cricetomys gambianus. This is the first detection of L. major in rodent species in Burkina Faso. Further studies are needed to confirm their role as reservoirs of L. major.},

In addition to present efforts to raise awareness, school children can be targeted to become peer and family health educators. The study was carried out to determine the knowledge of Lassa fever among secondary school children, and household practices that increase risk of the infection., STUDY DESIGN: In a cross sectional survey, 561 secondary school students randomly selected from schools in Edo State were interviewed by means of a self - administered questionnaire that sought information on knowledge of Lassa fever and practices within the home that favour rodent contact . Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 15., RESULTS: Knowledge of Lassa fever was poor among 259 (49.4\%) respondents, fair in 216 (41.2\%) and good in 49 (9.4\%). Female gender ({\textless} 0.01), monogamous family structure (p {\textless} 0.04) , and being in senior secondary class ( p=0.01) were predictors of high knowledge score. Self- reported Lassa fever risk conditions were found to be of low prevalence in 311(55.4\%) and high in 250 (44.6\%) homes, and associated with educational status of mother ( p=0.00) and father, (p =0.00)., CONCLUSION: School children in endemic communities lack good knowledge of Lassa fever, but when properly guided, have the potential to become peer and family educators.},

	abstract = {As Lassa fever continues to be a public health challenge in West Africa, it is critical to produce good maps of its risk pattern for use in active surveillance and control intervention. We identified eight spatial features related to the rubber plantation environment and used them as explanatory variables for Lassa fever (LF) outbreaks on the Uniroyal Liberian Agricultural Company (LAC) rubber plantation environment in Grand Bassa County, Liberia. We computed classical and spatial lag regression models on all spatial features, including proximity of residential camp to rubber tree-edge, main road in the plantation, LAC hospital, rice farmland, household refuse dump, human population density, post-harvest storage density of rice and density of rodent deterrent on rice storage. We found significant (p=0.0024) spatial autocorrelation between LF cases and the spatial features we have considered. We concluded that the rubber plantation environment influenced Mastomys species' breeding and transmission of Lassa virus along spatial scale to humans. The risk factors identified in this study offered a baseline for more effective surveillance and control of LF in the post-civil conflict Liberia. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

After having collected molecular evidence of an indigenous African hantavirus in 2006, an intensive investigation for new hantaviruses has been started in small mammals. Various novel hantaviruses have been molecularly identified not only in rodents but also in shrews and bats. In addition, the first African hantavirus, Sangassou virus, has been isolated and functionally characterized in cell culture. Less is known about the ability of these hantaviruses to infect humans and to cause diseases. To date, no hantavirus genetic material could be amplified from patients' specimens collected in Africa. Serological studies in West Africa, based on a battery of screening and confirmatory assays, led to the detection of hantavirus antibodies in the human population and in patients with putative hantavirus disease. In addition to this overview, we present original data from seroepidemiological and field studies conducted in the Southern part of Africa. A human seroprevalence rate of 1.0\% (n=1442) was detected in the South African Cape Region whereas no molecular evidence for the presence of hantavirus was found in 2500 small animals trapped in South Africa and Namibia.

Four main vector / pathogen complexes are classically recognized, with the louse Pediculus humanus acting as vector for B. recurrentis and the soft ticks Ornithodoros sonrai, O. erraticus and O. moubata acting as vectors for Borrelia crocidurae, B. hispanica and B. duttonii, respectively. Our aim was to investigate the epidemiology of the disease in West, North and Central Africa., METHODS AND FINDINGS: From 2002 to 2012, we conducted field surveys in 17 African countries and in Spain. We investigated the occurrence of Ornithodoros ticks in rodent burrows in 282 study sites. We collected 1,629 small mammals that may act as reservoir for Borrelia infections. Using molecular methods we studied genetic diversity among Ornithodoros ticks and Borrelia infections in ticks and small mammals. Of 9,870 burrows investigated, 1,196 (12.1\%) were inhabited by Ornithodoros ticks. In West Africa, the southern and eastern limits of the vectors and Borrelia infections in ticks and small mammals were 13degreeN and 01degreeE, respectively. Molecular studies revealed the occurrence of nine different Ornithodoros species, including five species new for science, with six of them harboring Borrelia infections. Only B. crocidurae was found in West Africa and three Borrelia species were identified in North Africa: B. crocidurae, B. hispanica, and B. merionesi., CONCLUSIONS: Borrelia Spirochetes responsible for relapsing fever in humans are highly prevalent both in Ornithodoros ticks and small mammals in North and West Africa but Ornithodoros ticks seem absent south of 13degreeN and small mammals are not infected in these regions. The number of Ornithodoros species acting as vector of relapsing fever is much higher than previously known.},

The virus was isolated from an African wood mouse (Hylomyscus simus), trapped in a forest habitat in Guinea, West Africa. Here, we report on the characterization of the genetic and functional properties of the virus. The complete genome of SANGV was determined and showed typical hantavirus organization. The small (S), medium (M), and large (L) genome segments containing genes encoding nucleocapsid protein, two envelope glycoproteins, and viral polymerase were found to be 1,746, 3,650, and 6,531 nucleotides long, respectively. The exact 5' and 3' termini for all three segments of the SANGV genome were determined and were predicted to form the panhandle structures typical of bunyaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses of all three segment sequences confirmed SANGV as a Murinae-associated hantavirus most closely related to the European Dobrava-Belgrade virus. We showed, however, that SANGV uses beta(1) integrin rather than beta(3) integrin and decay-accelerating factor (DAF)/CD55 as an entry receptor. In addition, we demonstrated a strong induction of type III lambda interferon (IFN-lambda) expression in type I IFN-deficient Vero E6 cells by SANGV. These properties are unique within Murinae-associated hantaviruses and make the virus useful in comparative studies focusing on hantavirus pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever remains a serious challenge to public health in West Africa threatening both local residents in rural areas and those who serve them, particularly medical care providers. Given the ecology of the rodent host and conditions in the endemic area, a vaccine is mandatory for control. The challenge is to overcome the scientific, political and economic obstacles to producing a human use vaccine candidate. There are some scientific issues to resolve. It is known that the G-protein confers protection but we do not know its duration. If the N-protein is also included there may be a better duration of protection but it is unclear whether the N-protein as a vaccine may possibly enhance the infection. The original vaccinia vector must be replaced by new vectors, chimeras or by delivering DNA in some format. A live vaccine is attractive because it can confer protection in a single shot. A killed vaccine is more stable, particularly for distribution in the tropics but usually requires repeated shots. For practical reasons a live vaccine format should probably be pursued, which could then be combined with a yellow fever vaccine, using the same cold chains, since this disease occupies the same endemic areas in West Africa. Lassa vaccine initiatives have suffered from a lack of funding in the past but bioterrorism has brought new resources to Lassa virus science. Adequate funding and applications of new vaccine technologies give hope that we may soon see a vaccine in clinical trials. However, the difficulty of conducting trials in endemic areas and lack of political stability remain serious problems.},

	abstract = {We have investigated whether naturally induced immunity to Plasmodium falciparum thrombospondin related adhesive protein contributes to protection against malaria in humans. We have carried out a case control study in children living in an endemic region of West Africa to reveal associations between PfTRAP seroprevalence and the risk of cerebral malaria. Sera collected from the case and control groups were analysed by ELISA to compare their serum reactivity against PfTRAP, the circumsporozoite protein and the merozoite surface protein 1. Children with uncomplicated malaria had a significantly higher PfTRAP seroprevalence when compared to children with cerebral malaria. The risk of developing cerebral malaria appeared to depend on the reciprocal relationship between sporozoite inoculation rates and humoral immunity against PfTRAP. Our results suggest that naturally induced humoral immunity against PfTRAP contributes to the development of protection against severe malaria. Experimentally induced immunity against TRAP in different rodent models has consistently proven to elicit a high degree of protection against malaria. This together with the functional properties of TRAP and data describing CD4 and CD8 epitopes for PfTRAP indicate that this molecule could increase the protective efficiency of available sporozoite malaria vaccines.},

The parasites that were used as antigen in the immune lysis tests were collected from infected mice when variable antigen type (VAT) homogeneous populations were used, from goats for infection with stocks and clones from Nigeria, The Gambia and Uganda, and from cattle for Kenyan stocks. Reciprocal cross-reactivity between sera and parasites was found between all the stocks and clones from Nigeria and The Gambia with the exception of one clone from Nigeria that was not recognized by antisera to a clone from The Gambia. There was also cross-reactivity between a stock and clone from Uganda and stocks and clones from Nigeria and The Gambia. Sera from goats infected with stocks and clones from Nigeria, The Gambia and Uganda recognized parasite populations that were homogeneous for one VAT (ILDat 1.2) of the rodent infective stock from Nigeria. Some antisera to West African stocks recognized another stable variant from a Ugandan stock adapted to rodents (ILDat 2.1), indicating that these VATs were expressed in the repertoires of the heterologous stocks. There was no cross-reaction between stocks from Nigeria, The Gambia or Uganda with Kenyan stocks. A stock from Galana (Kenya) and Bamburi (Kenya) showed reciprocal cross-reactivity. Two other Kenyan stocks, from Kilifi and Likoni, also showed cross-reactivity by immune lysis but showed no antigenic relationship with the other Kenyan stocks.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever is an acute febrile disease of West Africa, where there are as many as 300,000 infections a year and an estimated 3000 deaths. As control of the rodent host is impracticable at present, the best immediate prospect is vaccination. We tested as potential vaccines in rhesus monkeys a closely related virus, Mopeia virus (two monkeys), and a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the Lassa virus glycoprotein gene, V-LSGPC (four monkeys). Two monkeys vaccinated with the New York Board of Health strain of vaccinia virus as controls died after challenge with Lassa virus. The two monkeys vaccinated with Mopeia virus developed antibodies measurable by radioimmunoprecipitation prior to challenge, and they survived challenge by Lassa virus with minimal physical or physiologic disturbances. However, both showed a transient, low-titer Lassa viremia. Two of the four animals vaccinated with V-LSGPC had antibodies to both Lassa glycoproteins, as determined by radioimmunoprecipitation. All four animals survived a challenge of Lassa virus but experienced a transient febrile illness and moderate physiologic changes following challenge. Virus was recoverable from each of these animals, but at low titer and only during a brief period, as observed for the Mopeia-protected animals. We conclude that V-LSGPC can protect rhesus monkeys against death from Lassa fever.},

Omnivorous, it is more or less a commensal of the man. The blood of 20 adults male and female specimens captured in the Sine Saloum (Fatik) and Presqu'Ille du Cap Vert (Dakar) regions was examined (peripheric blood smears). In 60 p. 100 (12/20) of hemograms, an intraerythrocytic organism of the genus Grahamella Brumpt 1911 was observed. Rod-shaped and carmine-coloured by staining technic of May-Grunwald and Giemsa, it is an unflagellate element. Slightly narrowed in the median part, it is 1 to 1.5 mu long and 0.25 mu wide. Multiplication by bipartition in the red cell plasma that may be occupied by 30 to 40 Grahamella. In chronic infection without morbid signs. 1/50 to 1/60 hematocyte is only infected. Electron micrograph of thin sections of red cells infected by Grahamella shows an element with a cell wall surrounding cytoplasmic masses which are enclosed in a cytoplasmic membrane. Nuclear region (bundles of moniliform chains = nucleic acids) is not surrounded by a nuclear membrane. Intraerythrocytic position. Bipolar densification of the cell plasma. The prokaryote is directly included in the erythrocyte plasma : no host cell vacuole is visible. Stress, polyinfection, polyparasitism or immuno-depressor effects, determine an intense proliferation of Grahamella by micrococcus elements (diameter : 0.1 to 0.3 mu) invading the systemic circulation. In that cases : septicaemia, anaemia; haematopoiesis with respiratory and nervous disorders; hyperthermia and weakness precede the death. This prokaryote is the first Baratonellacae found in the blood of the Giant Rat. It is namded Grahamella knaiae n. sp ("Kania" is the name of C. gambianus in "serere" language of Fatik region of Senegal). The fleas seem to be the vectors or this prokaryotic element.},

Here we describe four additional new species supported by morphological and molecular evidence, all collected by the late William Stanley. Two of the new taxa are sympatric and come from the poorly known left bank (direction source to mouth) of the Congo River. One of these (Hylomyscus pygmaeus sp. nov.) is easily recognized. as it is tiny and significantly smaller than any known species of the genus; the second new species (Hylomyscus thornesmithae sp. nov.) is also small, and syntopic with the first. The third new species (Hylomyscus stanleyi sp. nov.), from the SW corner of Tanzania, is quite large and had been previously included within the hypodigm of Hylomyscus anseM following its recognition from within the synonymy of Hylomyscus denniae. The fourth species (Hylonwscus mpungamachagorum sp. nov.) is from Mahale Mountains National Park, western Tanzania.

We performed an integrative study that allowed us to detect the existence of at least two species in the collected specimens. Two molecular clades, corresponding to different karyotypes, were recovered. By comparison with type specimens and using classical morphometric analyses, we are able to confirm the presence of L. linulus and L. striatus in Guinea. We redescribe the skull and dental characters of the poorly known L. linulus and report its standard karyotype formula (2N = 56, NFa = 66). We did not collect any L. zebra in Guinea despite its presence in South Mali. In conclusion, the distributions of L. striatus and L. linulus described for Guinea and, including the previously reported L. bellieri, three species are now known to occur in this country.

This study investigates the genetic diversity and possible origins of black rats from Benin, West Africa. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in 90 individuals from nine localities in Benin. These sequences were subsequently compared to 390 other cytochrome b haplotypes from individuals from various European, Asian, American and African localities. Nucleotide polymorphism analysis, haplotype network and maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree reconstructions showed low mitochondrial diversity in black rats from Benin. Our results also suggest at least two distinct introduction events: one introduction probably occurred during the spice trade (15th-17th century) through the Indies Road connecting Europe to Asia. Other introduction events could have occurred more recently following the intensification of globalized trade from the eighteenth century, and onwards.},

The mean pack size [plus or minus] SD were 4 [plus or minus]1.19 and 4.5[plus or minus]1.3 during the wet and the dry seasons, respectively. Golden jackal was observed feeding mostly on rodents and plant materials. The food items consumed were significantly differed ([chi]2 = 20.33, df = 5, P{\textless}0.05) between both seasons. They were mostly active during early morning (6:00-8:00) and late afternoon (16:00-18:00). The overall status of the current population does not appear in an immediate danger. However, there are many conservation problems that could affect the species in the future in the area. Therefore, appropriate conservation measures should be taken in to consideration to protect golden jackal and create suitable habitat.},

One pair brought a total of 88 prey items (a minimum of 80 prey individuals) during the breeding period from nest-making to the point at which the nestling was about to fledge at 106 days old. Prey animals comprised three vertebrate taxa (mammal, reptile and bird), of which mammals dominated, ranging over Primates, rodents, carnivores, hyraxes and bovids. Diversity of prey taxa increased in the later stage of the nestling period. As well as breeding periodicity and prey selectivity, I describe details of some novel behaviours related to breeding ecology of the species, such as nest material delivery, copulation, feeding behaviour, unilateral eye closure, alert behaviour and defensive behaviour.},

In Ghana, attempts are being made to intensify the domestication efforts because grasscutter meat is a delicacy and huge agribusiness opportunities are expected. Tameness and reproductive ability are two important traits that underlie any successful animal domestication event. Androgen receptor gene has been reported to influence behaviour and fertility. The objective of this study was to identify genetic polymorphism in the androgen receptor gene that is likely to influence tameness and reproductive traits. Tissue samples were collected from a total of 116 including 81 domestic and 35 wild grasscutters in Accra and Mankessim, respectively, and genotyped at the androgen receptor glutamine repeat (ARQ) locus. Results of this study showed that ARQ ranges from six to 19 repeats and heterozygosities (H) were 0.769 and 0.778 for domestic and wild females respectively, indicating that this locus is highly polymorphic in grasscutters. As this locus influences transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor gene, these polymorphisms could influence tameness and reproductive traits in grasscutter. However, further studies are required to test the association of these polymorphisms with phenotypes.},

	abstract = {The ability to differentiate among conspecifics on the basis of genetic relatedness can be advantageous in kin and mate selection. Selection of mates that are of an intermediate degree of relatedness maximizes the propagation of shared genes to offspring, while minimizing the accumulation of deleterious recessive alleles that can result from close inbreeding. Odors produced from various glandular surfaces of the body have been shown to influence discrimination of conspecifics in numerous taxa, including the order Rodentia. We investigated whether female Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) discriminate between the odors of familiar and foreign males by conducting scent experiments. We simultaneously presented odors that had been collected on acrylic cubes from the anal gland of a familiar (non-dispersed) and a foreign male as well as an unscented control, and recorded the response of focal pregnant and non-pregnant females (n = 19). Non-pregnant females responded differently to the odors of the scent cubes, sniffing the scent collected from the foreign male significantly longer than either the familiar male or control odor, whereas there was no difference in the response of pregnant females. We conclude that male familiarity may influence female mate choice, as familiarity is reliably correlated with relatedness in this population. Based on prior knowledge about the social behavior of Cape ground squirrels, the ability to discriminate between familiar and foreign males may be used by females as an inbreeding avoidance mechanism, as close inbreeding can be avoided by mating with foreign males.},

	abstract = {1. Ebola virus is responsible for the fatal Ebola virus disease (EVD). 2. Identifying the distribution area of the Ebola virus is crucial for understanding the risk factors conditioning the emergence of new EVD cases. Existing distribution models have underrepresented the potential contribution that reservoir species and vulnerable species make in sustaining the presence of the virus. 3. In this paper, we map favourable areas for Ebola virus in Africa according to environmental and zoogeographical descriptors, independent of human-to-human transmissions. We combine two different biogeographical approaches: analysis of mammalian distribution types (chorotypes), and distribution modelling of the Ebola virus. 4. We first obtain a model defining the distribution of environmentally favourable areas for the presence of Ebola virus. Based on a review of mammal taxa affected by or suspected of exposure to the Ebola virus, we model favourable areas again, this time according to mammalian chorotypes. We then build a combined model in which both the environment and mammalian distributions explain the favourable areas for Ebola virus in the wild. 5. We demonstrate that mammalian biogeography contributes to explaining the distribution of Ebola virus in Africa, although vegetation may also underscore clear limits to the presence of the virus. Our model suggests that the Ebola virus may be even more widespread than previously suspected, given that additional favourable areas are found throughout the coastal areas of West and Central Africa, stretching from Cameroon to Guinea, and extend further East into the East African Lakes region. 6. Our findings show that the most favourable area for the Ebola virus is significantly associated with the presence of the virus in non-human mammals. Core areas are surrounded by regions of intermediate favourability, in which human infections of unknown source were found. The difference in association between humans and other mammals and the virus may offer further insights on how EVD can spread.},

Sex, social tactic, season and food availability are important factors influencing activity budgets. However, few field studies have tested their influences. The African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) lives in highly seasonal habitats in southern Africa, and individuals can adopt different social tactics. We investigated seasonal changes in activity budgets of different tactics and predicted that individuals will reduce their activity in the non-breeding season to save energy when food availability is low and that young non-breeding adults ('philopatrics') invest mainly in activities related to gaining body mass to increase survival probability. We predicted old adults ('breeders'), which bred during the previous breeding season, to invest mainly in maintenance of their social status. We conducted 90 focal observations during the non-breeding season and 73 during the breeding season. Activity budgets of striped mice were season and tactic specific, with philopatrics, but not breeders, reducing activity when food availability was low, possibly to decrease energy expenditure. Philopatrics of both sexes foraged and basked more in the breeding season than during the non-breeding season. Male philopatrics gained body mass and female philopatrics maintained their body mass in both seasons. Sex-specific differences occurred during the breeding season, when female breeders foraged more than male breeders, while male breeders chased other individuals more than female breeders. These findings indicate that individuals adopting different social tactics display distinct behaviors to fulfill tactic-specific energetic needs.},

Although the fossil record suggests an ecosystem quite different than that of the region today, we understand little about the ecological factors that contributed to this disparity. The site of Elandsfontein (EFT) dates to between 1.0 and 0.6 million years ago (Ma), preserves in situ lithic and faunal materials found in direct association with each other, and provides the rare opportunity to examine the relationship between hominin behavioral variability and landscape heterogeneity in a winter rainfall ecosystem. In this study, we examine the stable carbon isotopic composition of a large sample (n = 81) of Cape dune mole-rats (Bathyergus suillus) and contemporaneous large mammals ({\textgreater}6 kg; n = 194) from EFT. We find that [delta]13C values of B. suillus are significantly different to those of contemporaneous large mammals from EFT indicating a significant presence of plants utilizing the C4 photosynthetic pathway during the mid-Pleistocene, in contrast to present C3 dominated ecosystems along the west coast of South Africa. Additionally, we find that artifact density at EFT localities is positively correlated with [delta]13C values in B. suillus enamel suggesting that evidence of more intense hominin occupation may be associated with the presence of more C4 vegetation. Lastly, we hypothesize that this unique distribution of vegetation 1) provided abundant resources for both hominin and non-hominin taxa and 2) may have concentrated hominin and animal behavior in certain places on the ancient landscape.

And where they prove harmful, more information can assist to evaluate and control the effects rats have on man. This article reviews the studies that have been carried out on wild rats in Nigeria and other parts of Africa. The studies reviewed in this article, on the one hand, showcase the vital contribution rats make to maintaining biodiversity across various ecological zones within the country. On the other hand, the article recognizes the role of certain species of multimammate rat and the African wood mouse as reservoirs of the deadly Lassa virus. Based on these parallel lines of evidence, it is concluded that while it is crucial to control commensal rats that dwell in close proximity to humans, it is equally important to conserve wild rats in the natural environment.},

In present study, the phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships in the genus Jaculus from Iran were examined using molecular, geometric morphometric and morphologic data. Our molecular analyses indicated two monophyletic clades which contain J. jaculus and J. blanfordi. There is a high amount of genetic interspecific distance (12.7\%) between J. jaculus and J. blanfordi, while the intraspecific divergence within these two species is low. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of morphometric variables were significant (P{\textless}0.05) and shows that J. jaculus is significantly smaller than J. blanfordi. Statistical Analysis on outline data shows that there is an intraspecific geographic variation in 2nd lower molar shape in J. blanfordi so that northern populations are determinable from the south ones (Pvalue= 0.016). Although the findings strengthen an idea of presence of two subspecies in northeast and southeast of Iran, it would require further studies.

	abstract = {The stable isotope composition of small mammal tissues has the potential to provide detailed information about terrestrial palaeoclimate and environments, because their remains are abundant in palaeontological and archaeological sites, and they have restricted home ranges. Applications to the Quaternary record, however, have been sparse and limited by an acute lack of understanding of small mammal isotope ecology, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Here we document the oxygen and carbon isotope composition of Gerbillinae (gerbil) tooth apatite across a rainfall gradient in northwestern Africa, in order to test the relative influences of the 18O/16O in precipitation or moisture availability on gerbil teeth values, the sensitivity of tooth apatite 13C/12C to plant responses to moisture availability, and the influence of developmental period on the isotopic composition of gerbil molars and incisors. The results show that the isotopic composition of molars and incisors from the same individuals differs consistent with the different temporal periods reflected by the teeth; molar teeth are permanently rooted and form around the time of birth, whereas incisors grow continuously. The results indicate that tooth choice is an important consideration for applications as proxy Quaternary records, but also highlights a new potential means to distinguish seasonal contexts. The oxygen isotope composition of gerbil tooth apatite is strongly correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP) below 600 mm, but above 600 mm the teeth reflect the oxygen isotope composition of local meteoric water instead. Predictably, the carbon isotope composition of the gerbil teeth reflected C3 and C4 dietary inputs, however arid and mesic sites could not be distinguished because of the high variability displayed in the carbon isotope composition of the teeth due to the microhabitat and short temporal period reflected by the gerbil. We show that the oxygen isotope composition of small mammal teeth strongly reflects moisture availability in semi-arid and arid environments and would provide an excellent record of palaeo-aridity in a terrestrial setting. The results illustrate that an understanding of an animal's physiology is essential for interpreting the animal's isotopic responses to external contexts, especially in arid zones.

	abstract = {Understanding historical influences of climate and physiographic barriers in shaping patterns of biodiversity remains limited for many regions of the world. For mammals of continental Africa, phylogeographic studies, particularly for West African lineages, implicate both geographic barriers and climate oscillations in shaping small mammal diversity. In contrast, studies for southern African species have revealed conflicting phylogenetic patterns for how mammalian lineages respond to both climate change and geologic events such as river formation, especially during the Pleistocene. However, these studies were often biased by limited geographic sampling or exclusively focused on large-bodied taxa. We exploited the broad southern African distribution of a savanna-woodland-adapted African rodent, Gerbilliscus leucogaster (bushveld gerbil) and generated mitochondrial, autosomal and sex chromosome data to quantify regional signatures of climatic and vicariant biogeographic phenomena. Results indicate the most recent common ancestor for all G.leucogaster lineages occurred during the early Pleistocene. We documented six divergent mitochondrial lineages that diverged [approximately]0.270-0.100mya, each of which was geographically isolated during periods characterized by alterations to the course of the Zambezi River and its tributaries as well as regional megadroughts'. Results demonstrate the presence of a widespread lineage exhibiting demographic expansion [approximately]0.065-0.035mya, a time that coincides with savanna-woodland expansion across southern Africa. A multilocus autosomal perspective revealed the influence of the Kafue River as a current barrier to gene flow and regions of secondary contact among divergent mitochondrial lineages. Our results demonstrate the importance of both climatic fluctuations and physiographic vicariance in shaping the distribution of southern African biodiversity.},

We detected low genetic diversity in Kenyan Highland populations of both genera, consistent with smaller historical population sizes in this region. We additionally tested predictions that Albertine Rift populations are older and more persistently isolated compared to the Kenyan Highlands. Phylogenetic analyses support greater historical isolation among Albertine Rift populations of both shrews and mice compared to the Kenyan Highlands and suggest that there are genetically isolated populations from both focal genera in the Itombwe Massif, Democratic Republic of Congo.

Having information on the invasion range of exotic species is crucial for understanding the ecology of invasive spread and for making good conservation and management planning to address this problem. At the beginning of the 20th century, nutria was introduced into Asia. Nutria was recorded for the first time in Iran in 1995. In the present study we proposed a multiple spatial scale approach to predict the invasion trends of the nutria in Iran, and to define up the "suitable scale" for predicting the invasion trends of this species. Our results highlighted the importance of environmental variables including vegetation density (for food and nesting) and water resource (streams, rivers, and lakes) in distribution of the nutria. Potential areas for the presence of the nutria are located near the Caspian Sea, west and central Iran which receive more precipitation than other parts of the country. Therefore, these parts of Iran may face a much greater risk of invasion risk in the future. Moreover, these results can show the possible risk of nutria invasion to the northern and western neighbors of Iran. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The microfaunas, especially the rodents, of which there are at least 8 genera, indicate that the limestones accumulated slightly earlier than the oldest mammalian levels of the Fayum, Egypt (Priabonian) meaning that the deposits are likely to be Bartonian.

In Southeastern Nigeria, its known range is strictly limited to the localities close to the Cameroon border and just east of the Cross River. This article reports some original data on the diet of B. nigripes, the first objectively positive data on this species according to the analysis of their stomach contents. Moreover, these are the first data collected in Nigeria, including the first known record west of the Cross River. B. nigripes seems to be slowly expanding its range westward. Most of its prey were vertebrates, mainly mammals, followed by reptiles and birds. Invertebrate prey was also found, mainly insects, followed by centipedes. In terms of their frequency of occurrence, insects and other arthropods (50.48\%) were consumed significantly more often than any other type of prey. Both arthropods (88.88\%) and mammals (88.88\%) were almost always present in the examined stomachs. Larger prey (mammals), such as Cricetomys emini (1.9\% of the total number of prey) and Xerus erythropus (0.95\%) were occasionally preyed upon, as well as small snakes (1.9\%). Comparing these results with the limited information available thus far, it is evident that there are more prey taxa, in addition to food categories, than previously estimated, and overall this demonstrates that arthropods and mammals are the most commonly consumed prey, the first because they are certainly more numerous, while the latter are far more significant in terms of biomass. In fact, the analysis indicates that mammals (79.21\%), and especially large rodents (59.23\%), were the main contributors in terms of biomass. Conversely, small prey, in particular arthropods, some of which are tiny, are of decidedly low trophic significance (5.43\%).},

	abstract = {West African Mountains of the Cameroon Volcanic Line harbour two montane-endemic species of laminated-toothed rats (Otomys), which represent the most westerly occurrence of the genus. We explore here through mtDNA sequencing and cranial morphometrics the taxonomic status and phylogenetic relationships of O. burtoni (Mt Cameroon) and O. occidentalis (Mts Oku and Gotel). We conclude that both species are valid and can be discriminated by molecular data, as well as quantitative and qualitative cranial characters. From molecular data, O. occidentalis and O. burtoni are closest neighbours (p-distance = 7.5-8.5\%) and weakly associated sister species (suggesting a single West African radiation) and both are sister clades to a well supported clade of central, East and northeast African members of the O. typus s.l. and O. tropicalis s.l. species complexes from mountain ranges comprising the East African 'Montane Circle' and Ethiopian Highlands. Re-evaluation of the evolutionary origins of the allopatric Otomys populations in equatorial Africa is undertaken in light of fossil evidence of a southern African origin of the genus. We can conclude that Otomys reached the Cameroon Volcanic Line via corridors of temperate grasslands during the Late Pliocene. Our data support the hypothesis that, following major peripatric speciation events at around 2.3 to 2.03 Ma (from East Africa into West and North Africa respectively), further speciation occurred across neighbouring mountain ranges in West, Central-East and North-East Africa. Estimated molecular dates of speciation events in Otomys reveal close congruence with well-constrained geochronological estimates, pertinently the uplift of the Albertine Rift in the Early Pleistocene. These regional analyses reveal how peripatric speciation events established narrow-range endemics of Otomys on principal stratovolcanoes across the East African plateau and Cameroon.

	abstract = {The Eastern Afromontane region of Africa is characterized by striking levels of endemism and species richness accompanied by significant conservation threat, a pattern typical across biodiversity hotspots. Using multi-locus molecular data under a coalescent species tree framework we identify major cryptic biogeographic patterns within and between two endemic montane small mammal species complexes, Hylomyscus mice and Sylvisorex shrews, co-distributed across the Albertine Rift and Kenya Highlands of the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot (EABH). Hypotheses put forward to account for the high diversity of the region include retention of older palaeo-endemic lineages across major regions in climatically stable refugia, as well as the accumulation of lineages associated with more recent differentiation between allopatric populations separated by unsuitable habitat during periods of Pleistocene aridification. Sympatric pairs of sister lineages were found to have significantly older divergence times than allopatric pairs. Genetic analyses and historical distribution modeling suggest that regional meta-populations have persisted since the Pliocene to mid-Pleistocene across a climatic gradient from the Albertine Rift in the west to the Kenya Highlands in the east for both focal taxa. Differing patterns of regional sub-division and demographic expansion were detected and are consistent with differing life histories as well as shared responses to regional variation in stability of suitable habitat. There is also strong support in both mice and shrew species for Late Miocene divergence with subsequent range expansion into sympatry in previously unidentified cryptic species pairs. These results highlight the broad temporal scale at which climatic and geological changes may have facilitated rare dispersal events between montane habitats as well as the long-term persistence of populations in both the Albertine Rift and the Kenyan Highlands that together contributed to the high species diversity and endemism in the EABH.

We examined whether harassment was part of alloparental care by comparing harassment behaviours among different age and sex classes in Cape ground squirrel social groups. We also assessed how individuals adjusted their behaviour dependent on levels of risk by examining the Cape ground squirrel's harassment behaviour among non-venomous, and two species of venomous snakes. We found adult females with emerged juvenile offspring took the most risk, harassing for longer durations and at higher intensities than other group members, suggesting that snake harassment was a maternal behaviour. Females with juvenile offspring only harassed the highest risk elapid snake but increased vigilance and inspection with increasing snake risk suggesting that the Cape ground squirrel can discriminate between different types of snake predators.},

Genome sequences have identified evidence for a striking expansion of and positive selection in gene families associated with immunity. Bats have also been known to be hosts of malaria parasites for over a century, and as hosts, they possess perhaps the most phylogenetically diverse set of hemosporidian genera and species. To provide a molecular framework for the study of these parasites, we surveyed bats in three remote areas of the Upper Guinean forest ecosystem. We detected four distinct genera of hemosporidian parasites: Plasmodium, Polychromophilus, Nycteria, and Hepatocystis. Intriguingly, the two species of Plasmodium in bats fall within the clade of rodent malaria parasites, indicative of multiple host switches across mammalian orders. We show that Nycteria species form a very distinct phylogenetic group and that Hepatocystis parasites display an unusually high diversity and prevalence in epauletted fruit bats. The diversity and high prevalence of novel lineages of chiropteran hemosporidians underscore the exceptional position of bats among all other mammalian hosts of hemosporidian parasites and support hypotheses of pathogen tolerance consistent with the exceptional immunology of bats.},

Murine rodents were far more numerous than gerbilline rodents, and among them, Mastomys erythroleucus was the dominant species, being caught in high numbers in all habitats. Arvicanthis niloticus and Praomys daltoni were also abundant, followed by Mastomys natalensis and Gerbilliscus guineae. Abundances were high at the beginning of the rainy season when reproductive activity was low in all species. At the end of the rainy season, murine rodents were actively involved in reproduction, while gerbilline rodents were at their lowest density. Significant changes in relative abundance among habitats (including human dwellings) were observed between periods in some species, suggesting seasonal trends in habitat preferences. This may help species coexistence in this species-rich rodent community, in an area likely to be submitted to significant habitat alterations in the years to come.},

	abstract = {Associations among organisms are thought to form because the benefits, such as increased foraging efficiency or decreased risk of predation, outweigh any costs, such as resource competition. Though many interspecific associations have been described for closely related mammals, few studies have examined the associations between mammals in different orders. The yellow mongoose (Cynictus pencillata), a carnivore, and the Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), a rodent, co-occur in arid and semi-arid South Africa where they share sleeping burrows, predators, a similar body size, and the capability to emit alarm calls in response to predators. To investigate enhanced predator avoidance as a potential benefit explaining the persistence of this association, we assessed individual mongoose vigilance alone and with squirrels or other mongooses, and with varying interspecific group size, using field observations. We also tested for responses to conspecific and heterospecific alarm calls in both study species using playback experiments. The proportion of time mongoose individuals spent vigilant decreased in the presence of squirrels or other mongooses and was negatively correlated with interspecific group size; a similar pattern was previously shown for conspecific groups of Cape ground squirrels. These results are predicted by both the dilution and collective detection hypotheses. In addition, hetero- and conspecific alarm calls elicited vigilance responses in both species. These results suggest that both species can benefit from the collective detection and dilution arising from their interspecific association and that this interspecific association could be mutualistic.},

	abstract = {The black rat R. rattus and the Norway rat R. norvegicus are nocturnal rodents (Muridae), that originated in Asia but are now considered to be cosmopolitan because they can adapt to practically all types of environments. These species have been the object of many karyological studies that helped to establish a chromosomal polymorphism based on geographical distribution. For R. rattus, many geographical types have been described. An Asian type with a diploid number 2n = 42, that covers all of South and Southwest Asia, is considered to be the ancestral type. There is also a Japanese type with 2n = 42, a Sri-Lankan type with 2n = 40 located in West Asia, and an oceanic type with 2n = 38 that has spread through the rest of the world. For karyological study we followed the air-drying method. The chromosomes were observed with a NIKON H-III microscope under the 100x objective, after Giemsa staining was applied. Our karyological investigations of the genus Rattus carried out on 39 individuals of Rattus rattus and 15 of R. norvegicus. The karyotype of R. rattus shows a diploid number of 2n = 38 and a fundamental number of autosomes (NFa) varying from 58 to 60. It is interesting to note that only the oceanic type presents two large metacentric pairs of chromosomes, resulting from two successive Robertsonian fusions between the pairs 4-7 and the pairs 11-12. However, this chromosomal structure shows intra- and inter-populational variation. This karyotype reminds us of that defined in the Mediterranean, which corresponds to the oceanic type. It shows a supernumerary B chromosome with a frequency of 0.07 and the pair 13 has a variable morphology, probably due to a pericentric inversion, and gives the subtelocentric (ST) form with a frequency of 0.10. Otherwise, comparison of our results with those reported in the literature, particularly those for the Mediterranean, fit within the limits established for the oceanic type of R. rattus. On the contrary, in R. norvegicus the diploid number remains constant with 2n = 42 and a fundamental number of autosomes (NFa) of 62. These karyotypes are the same as those defined in North Africa and Europe. Finally, we suggest that our specimens of R. rattus and R. norvegicus show a close affinity with those identified in Europe.},

	abstract = {The African pygmy mouse, Mus minutoides, is one of the very few mammal species that deviates from the classical mammalian XX/XY sex chromosome system by presenting a high proportion of fully fertile sex-reversed females. Since the still unknown sex reversal mutation is X-linked (X*), they are designated as X*Y females. Until now, X*Y females had only been identified in Southern Africa, but data were lacking for the rest of the vast sub-Saharan distribution range of this species. In this study, the PCR genotyping of the Y-linked Sry gene on 72 females from Western Africa (Guinea, Ivory Coast and Ghana) uncovered 10 sex-reversed females distributed in the 3 countries. This expands our understanding of the geographical distribution and temporal origin (dated at 0.9 mya) of the sex reversal mutation. In addition, we sequenced and analyzed a fragment of the Sry gene (including the complete high-mobility group, i.e. HMG box, and the partial C-terminal region). The results demonstrate the presence of multiple polymorphic copies of the gene as reported in other rodent species and reveal, more unexpectedly, an extremely high proportion of amino acid replacement within the HMG box. In effect, the predicted HMG box protein sequence similarity between some populations of M. minutoides is as low as 94.9\%, and at the interspecific level (within genus), it drops to only 91.1\% between M. minutoides and M. musculus.

Despite the severe ecological, economic and health impacts of this species, its evolutionary history has been little studied. We carried out extensive specimen sampling in Senegal, West Africa, and used microsatellite markers to describe the pattern and processes of invasion in this large continental area. The genetic data obtained were combined with historical knowledge concerning the presence of this species in Senegal. Data were analysed by a combination of Bayesian clustering and approximate Bayesian computation methods. The invasion pathways closely paralleled the history of human trade routes in Senegal. In several places, we detected the occurrence of multiple introductions from genetically different sources. Long-distance migration between towns and villages was also observed. Our findings suggest that genetic bottlenecks and admixture have played a major role in shaping the genetics of invasive black rats. These two processes may generate genetic novelty and favour rapid evolution along the invasion pathways.},

	abstract = {The taxonomic position of the westernmost representatives of the genus Dendromus in Africa is clarified herein associated with the recent capture of specimens in a range of habitats and elevations on Mount Nimba, Guinea. On the basis of morphological, morphometric and cytogenetic characters, we describe these animals as a new species. The distinguishing characteristics of the new species, with respect to D. melanotis and D. mystacalis from Gabon and Ghana, include the absence of a dorsal stripe and a larger body size. The new species is also smaller in size than D. oreas from Mount Cameroon. The new species has morphological similarities with karyo-typed specimens of D. messorius from Ippy (Central African Republic) and the so-called D. melanotis from La Maboke, Gabon, but has a distinct karyotype. It is close in morphology to D. messorius from the Cameroon lowlands. This is the first time G and C banding were employed for members of the genus Dendromus, and the karyotype of the new species confirms that it may be a sibling species of the D. messorius "complex", for which the distribution and measure of species diversity in west central Africa are far from resolved. The new species occurs in Guinean and Liberian montane savannas of Mount Nimba and in banana and quinine plantations around Mount Ziama, Guinea. It is also known from the Ivory Coast. The presence of this new species highlights the importance of altitude savannas and forests of the Nimba region for conservation.},

The taxonomic rank of the principal genus group is assessed and the mode of diversification of species of the P. tullbergi complex in Afrotropical forests is discussed based on estimates of times to the most recent common ancestors and on tree topologies. This study documents for the first time the molecular and morphometrical distinctiveness of P. hartwigi and P. morio within the P. tullbergi species complex. Further studies including specimens of P. hartwigi from all its distribution range are needed to conclude on the status of P. obscurus. The monophyly of the genus Praomys is refuted. Times to the most recent common ancestors of major clades within the P. tullbergi species complex are estimated for the last 2.5 Mya and during the last 1 or 2 Mya for different species or forms. The lowland forest refuge hypothesis might well explain the diversification of P. misonnei, P. rostratus and P. tullbergi in the guineo-congolese forest block. The isolation of montane forests could have facilitated the divergence between the two montane forest forms P. hartwigi and P. obscurus and between populations of P. morio from the continent and those from the island of Bioko. Praomys populations (species) that inhabit the Cameroon Volcanic Line Praomys probably originated as lowland forms subsequently specialized to highland conditions.},

The second clade can be further divided into three sub-clades. The results of neutrality tests and mismatch distributions indicate that a population expansion occurred in these sub-clades. During the middle or upper Pleistocene, the west-Central African populations of R misonnei may have been isolated in four different forest refugia, followed by population expansion and secondary contact during more humid periods. High genetic diversity was observed in the region of the Bakossi highlands, and the Cameroon Volcanic Line limits the geographical distribution of clades. Thus it seems likely that this volcanic line has in the past constituted a barrier that prevented the east west exchange between R misonnei populations through the expansion of the montane forest habitat. Our results also highlight the role of the Sanaga and Ogooue-Ivindo rivers in shaping R misonnei genetic structure.},

The reconstructed demography showed that the evolutionary histories of the species are markedly different and that the expansion into North-West Africa by J. deserti was more recent than that of J. jaculus. The weak ecological separation between species and the signs of recent population growth and expansion of J. deserti suggest that its sympatric occurrence with J. jaculus is recent and that these species evolved in isolated populations, after diverging around the Pliocene[long dash]Pleistocene boundary.

Existing hypotheses of how Y. pestis is maintained within plague foci typically center on host abundance or diversity, but little attention has been paid to the importance of flea diversity in enzootic maintenance. Our study compares host and flea abundance and diversity along an elevation gradient that spans from low elevation sites outside of a plague focus in the West Nile region of Uganda ({\textasciitilde}725-1160 m) to higher elevation sites within the focus ({\textasciitilde}1380-1630 m). Based on a year of sampling, we showed that host abundance and diversity, as well as total flea abundance on hosts was similar between sites inside compared with outside the plague focus. By contrast, flea diversity was significantly higher inside the focus than outside. Our study highlights the importance of considering flea diversity in models of Y. pestis persistence.},

	abstract = {Gerbils of the genus Gerbillus represent an important part of small mammal diversity in arid regions of North Africa, but their taxonomy and evolutionary systematics and biogeography are still poorly known. Based on the recent collection of a series of gerbils in southern Morocco, including at the type localities of three endemic species, we gathered morphological, chromosomal and molecular data on a number of specimens that we compared with other available results. These data provide new insights into the geographical distribution of the endemic species known to date and suggest that an additional and previously undetected species may exist within this area. Multivariate analyses of morphometrical skull data validated the criteria used in the description of some of these species, while confirming the morphological similarity of a set of medium to large-sized species with hairy feet that can be considered sibling species. Karyotypes were useful for the specific assignation of a number of specimens. Molecular phylogenetics and divergence time estimates allow us to draw the first picture of the evolutionary relationships between endemic Gerbillus species from Morocco and related species of North Africa, and to estimate their respective timing of diversification. Most of the lineage emergence events took place during the Pleistocene, a period characterised by a global aridification of North Africa, but more importantly by important climatic and eustatic variations that may have played a role in species differentiation and subsequent expansion. This integrative approach proved to be essential in such species group including morphologically similar species. It also enables to propose testable hypotheses as to possible scenarios of emergence and evolution of these species along the western margin of the Sahara desert.},

Using pitfall buckets, small mammal traps, and mist-nets, between 1991 and 1993, we surveyed the small mammals in the Amani area in the East Usambara and Ambangulu area in the West Usambara to document the natural history of the local fauna. These surveys were conducted during the dry season annually between early July and early September. In this chapter, we outline the study sites, methodologies, capture rates, and other trapping details. A total of 18,563 sample-nights was accrued over the three-year study, and on these two massifs, we documented 12 crocidurine shrew, one macroscelidid elephant shrew, 19 bat, and 14 rodent species. Species accumulation curves suggest that additional trapping effort may be required in the East Usambara Mountains to have a more complete view of the local small mammal fauna. There was no significant difference in the number of individuals captured or measures of species diversity in the pitfall and trap lines that were installed in the same location during the course of this study, suggesting that repeated sampling did not negatively affect the small mammal fauna of the study areas.},

	abstract = {During three field seasons between 1991 and 1993, we carried out rodent inventories of the East and West Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. The general trapping protocol used involved both pitfall lines and trap lines (Sherman, Victor, and Museum Special traps), with a limited number of animals trapped within and outside of forest habitats by local people. A total of 885 individual rodents, representing 15 species, were collected during this study. For the East and West Usambara Mountains, 13 (12 native) and 12 (all native) rodent species were recorded, respectively. Most rodents were captured by trap lines (96.6\%); a few individuals were captured in the pitfall devices or brought to us by local people. The major exception is that all individuals of Dendromus (n = 11) obtained during the survey were in pitfall buckets. A total of 18,563 sample-nights were accrued over the three years, including 11,339 sample-nights (3314 pitfall-nights and 8025 trap-nights) in the East Usambara and 7224 sample-nights (1924 pitfall-nights and 5300 trap-nights) in the West Usambara Mountains. Based on species accumulation curves, no previously unrecorded species was trapped after 11,064 sample-nights in the East Usambara and after 5213 sample-nights in the West Usambara. However, a previously untrapped rodent (Graphiurus kelleni) was captured in the East Usambara on the third-to-last of 59 sampling days, suggesting that other non-canopy[long dash]restricted rodent species may have been missed during this survey. In a series of species accounts, information regarding the natural history of the different taxa handled during these surveys, including distribution, ecology, and condition of sexual organs, a list of referable specimens, and the trap devices that collected them, are presented. Trap and bucket lines combine to effectively sample most small- to medium-sized rodents. However, larger scansorial and canopy-restricted (squirrel) and fossorial (mole rat) species were not captured with our trapping methods, and these tabulations should not be considered a complete list of the small mammals of the Usambaras.},

	abstract = {We studied the co-occurrence of flea species in infracommunities of 16 rodents from four regions (South Africa, Tanzania, central Europe and western Siberia) using null models, and predicted that flea co-occurrences will be expressed more strongly in male than in female hosts. We examined patterns of co-occurrence (measured as the C score) in infracommunities of fleas that are parasitic on male and female hosts by comparing co-occurrence frequencies with those expected by chance. When a significant degree of nonrandomness in flea co-occurrences was detected, it indicated aggregative infracommunity structure. In Tanzanian rodents, no significant flea co-occurrences were detected in either male or female hosts. In a South African rodent, significant flea co-occurrences were not detected in males, but were found in females in some localities. In Palaearctic rodents, significant nonrandomness was detected either equally for males and females or more frequently in males than in females. Meta-analyses demonstrated that the frequency of the detection of nonrandomness in flea co-occurrences was significantly higher in male than in female hosts. The values of the standardized effect size (SES) for the C score differed significantly among host species, but not between host genders. When the Palaearctic hosts were analyzed separately, the effects of both host gender and species appeared to be significant, with the SES values for the C score in males being smaller than those in females. The strength of the gender difference in the manifestation of flea community structure increased with increasing gender difference in flea species richness, and with decreasing gender difference in flea prevalence for the Palaearctic hosts. We conclude that male hosts are the main drivers of flea infracommunity structure. However, the manifestation of gender bias in flea community structure varies among host species, and is likely determined by the pattern of species-specific spatial behavior.},

These sequences were compared to those of M. minutoides from other African countries and to eight other species of the genus Mus. We performed maximum likelihood, Bayesian and nested clade analyses, as well as neutrality tests and time estimates. We show that M. minutoides is a well-differentiated monophyletic species that separated from other pygmy mice 1.17 Myr ago. A distinct West Central African M. minutoides clade diverged early from the other African populations of the species, with a more recent common ancestor dating 0.14 Myr. West Central African populations are globally homogeneous, despite the present fragmentation of savannahs by the rain forest. However, our analyses show an unexpected vicariance between geographically close savannahs, embedded in the rain forest in Central Gabon. One of these populations is genetically more similar to very distant peripheral populations than to three closely neighbouring populations situated on both sides of the Ogooue River. A non-river geographical barrier probably persisted in this area, durably isolating these local populations. This hypothesis about the history of the savannah landscape should be testable through the biogeographical analysis of other strict savannah small mammal species.},

The decrease in size of the house mouse since the Gallo-Roman period, or likely since the end of the Middle-Ages, could be due to landscape clearance and expansion of cereal-like cultivations.

	abstract = {Rodent diagnosis has long remained obscured by the co-existence of cryptic species in many lineages. However, alternative and accessible methods, such as cytotaxonomy and DNA-based methods, are now available that allow biologists to accurately monitor biodiversity through the production of well documented lists of unambiguously species-specific identifications. As a continuation of our previous surveys of West African rodents, we here present the first rodent inventory of rodents from Northern Cameroon (as well as one locality in Western Chad) that fully relies on karyotypic and/or sequencing data. Doing so, we assess the presence of 18 species in this poorly documented region. Among them, we found several African spiny mice that could be referred as to A. johannis, a poorly documented species. Moreover, several Arvicanthis individuals could be aggregated with previously studied but still enigmatic specimens of ANI-2 and ANI-4 sensu Volobouev etal. (2002a,b), thus suggesting that they may all belong to one single species, namely A. rufinus. In addition, one specimen was shown to belong to a new biological species (Praomys sp.) that will deserve further taxonomic investigations. Finally, several Taterillus specimens were found with 2n =28-30 chromosomes and a XX/XY1Y2 sex chromosome system. On the basis of these new results as well as a reinterpretation of previously published data, we propose to refer these individuals as to the poorly documented Taterillus lacustris. Altogether, our data suggest that Northern Cameroon is a "phylogeographical node" for several rodent lineages which may be at least partly explained by the past changes within the Lake Chad basin. Keeping this in mind, there is little doubt that biodiversity will undergo important modifications in the coming decades, following the increasing aridity and the drastic reduction of Lake Chad.

This is also one of the most typical genus of subfamily Gerbillinae with about 17 morphospecies namely: M. persicus, M. hurrianae, M. zarudnyi M. vinogradovi, M. meridianus, M. libycus, M. crassus, M. tristrami, M. rex, M. tamariscinus, M. unguiculatus, M. shawi, M. grandis, M. sacramenti, M.dahli, M.chengi, M.arimalius . Of which first eight species have been recorded from the Iranian Plateau. There are minor differences between some species and hence, interspecific discrimination of specimens from each species is not always possible, even by polythetic methods using different taxonomic characters such as tympanic bullae, suprameatal triangle and external characters on material from museums and dental characters on archeozoological materials. Here, 26 morphological characters of 384 museum specimens belonging to 14 morphospecies of Meriones from North Africa, Iran and Central Asia were studied. This study review, 14 species of Meriones and based on the results, it seems that M.libycus, M. crassus and M. meridianus are complex species and need taxonomic revision. The cladistics analysis shows that M. vinogradovi could be forming ancestral species of genus Meriones, and west of Caspian Sea could be the center of origin for Meriones. Due to the presence of convergence regarding adaptation of different species of Meriones to similar environment, subgeneric morphological characters may cause homoplasies and paraphyletic subgenera the analysis of morphological character states matrix, using Mix program of Phylip shows different four clades that did not conform to the nominative subgenera and unveil probable homoplasy.},

Therefore, it was necessary to develop of Toshka on the west bank of the River Nile. Consequently, two specialized teams, one is national and the other is from WHO, were interested to study the health risk impact of the project on the vector-borne diseases and pests and to plan recommendations for prevention and feasible control of these diseases. The present study was initiated during spring of 2007 \& 2008, as spot light survey, on wild rodents and the arthropods having medical and/or veterinary importance. Whilst Psammomyes obesus Cretzchmar, 1828 was the only recognized rodent, the following arthropods were identified: the scorpion, Buthus quinquestriatus Hante en E., the insects, Cephus tabidus (F.), Ischnura senegalensis (Rambur, 1842), Mantis religiosa Linnaeus, 1758 and Tabanus taeniola Palisot de Beauvois, Culicoides riethi Kieffer, Anopheles sergenti Theobald and Phlebotomus papatasii (Scopoli).

We studied the variations in home-range size of black-tailed tree rats by radiotracking in winter 2006, 2007 and summer 2007 at three study sites along an aridity gradient in southern Africa. Home ranges were estimated using 100\% and 95\% minimum convex polygons (MCP) and 95\% and 50\% fixed kernels. Home ranges varied widely, from 166 to 80 199 m2 for males and from 46 to 8810 m2 for females. Males had larger home ranges than females, which supports a promiscuous mating system reported for the species. Although range size was reduced in both sexes in winter, this was not significant. We found no significant difference in home-range size along the aridity gradient. It is suggested that a combination of habitat productivity, season and breeding system influences the size of home range and that this species displays phenotypic flexibility in terms of its behavioural responses to these factors.},

Little has been published about the historical biogeography and diversification factors in members of this genus. Here we examined, using molecular data, the evolutionary relationships, and species boundaries within a species complex of Eliurus and the role of rivers in their evolution. Specifically, we tested the hypothesized monophyly of E. antsingy (west) and the recently described E. carletoni (north) using two mitochondrial genes, cytochrome It, the control region, and a nuclear marker, the Interstitial Retinol Binding Protein (IRBP). We also assessed the species boundaries of E. carletoni and examined phylogeographic patterns using two mitochondrial markers and an extensive geographic sampling. Molecular data show that members of the E. antsingy and E. carletoni complex together form a monophyletic group. Although samples provisionally assigned to E. carletoni based on morphological characters from different sites in northern Madagascar cluster in three separate phylogroups, they are monophyletic and assignable to this species. Rivers do not act as strict barriers to dispersal in E. carletoni. The demonstrated monophyly of both E. antsingy and E. carletoni contributes to the amounting evidence for a biogeographic link between the north and western regions of the island.

Until this study, the closest known populations in southern Africa were separated by nearly 2000 km from the closest populations in the Albertine Rift Valley. Here we document previously unknown populations of Myosorex, representing two new endemic taxa from montane forests adjacent to the Albertine Rift. In conjunction with additional data from Malawi, we fill in major gaps in our knowledge of the biodiversity and distribution of this genus in the areas of the Albertine and Malawi Rift Valleys. We demonstrate that this gap is an artefact of survey effort and collecting serendipity. The two new species described herein, as well as other species of Myosorex from north of the Zambezi River, exhibit limited distributions and are confined to montane habitats, typically above 1000 m. Our new species of Myosorex from Kahuzi-Biega NP (DRC) is the second known species of Myosorex from that park where it is syntopic with Myosorex babaulti. This is the first time that two species of Myosorex co-occur in any forest north of the Zambezi River. This suggests either sympatric speciation or a secondary re-invasion during times of climatic amelioration and forest expansion. The two species described here (Myosorex jejei and Myosorex bururiensis) are associated with two phenetically-defined species groups: the former with a more narrow hexagon-shaped skull, long-tail, and short claws ('narrow-headed group') and the latter with a more broad hexagon-shaped skull, short tail and long claws ('broad-headed group').},

The levels of species replacement ([beta]-diversity) are evaluated along these three different longitudinal gradients. Twenty-two sites were inventoried, six along the Soahany River, five along the Manambolo River, and 11 along the Mangoky River. Thirty-five species of small mammals were documented at these sites, composed of 21 species of endemic Afrosoricida (Tenrecidae); two species of Soricomorpha including one endemic (Suncus madagascariensis) and one introduced (S. murinus); and 12 species of Rodentia including 10 endemics (Nesomyidae) and two introduced species (Ratios rattus and Mus musculus). There was a correlation between species richness and the length of each river basin: Mangoky has the greatest species richness (29 taxa), followed by the Manambolo (11 taxa) and the Soahany (10 taxa). [alpha]-diversity augments with increasing habitat complexity and surface area. Humid forest sites in the central highlands near the Zomandao River (the source of the Mangoky) possess high [alpha]-diversity. For dry forest sites, those towards the interior in relatively large forested areas have greater [alpha]-diversity measures than those of smaller or coastal forest sites. [beta]-diversity augments along the river systems with increasing habitat heterogeneity. The transect along the Soahany River has the highest [beta]-diversity values, indicating higher levels of species turnover than the other two river systems.},

	abstract = {Mechanisms behind variation in physiological traits may assist in explaining how certain traits have evolved. The ability of mammals to concentrate urine has been seen as an adaptation to xeric environments. Urine osmolality and relative medullary thickness (RMT) are two indices which indicate urine concentrating powers. In addition, mammals living in xeric regions have lower water turnover rates (WTR) than their mesic counter-parts. The RMT, urine concentrating ability (UCA) and WTR of the Black-tailed Tree Rat, Thallomys nigricauda, were investigated at three study sites along an aridity gradient. We investigated the extent to which these traits are influenced by evolutionary adaptation and/or phenotypic flexibility. There was no significant difference in RMT between sites and no difference in osmolalities when site and season were taken into account In addition, there was no significant effect of site and season on WTR. This suggests that these traits might have a genetic basis, and reflect an evolutionary adaptation. Lack of differences in the renal traits in T. nigricauda across their range may be interpreted as lack of phenotypic flexibility. However, as a consequence of the degree of individual variation in the parameters measured there appears to be phenotypic flexibility with individuals responding to their specific conditions. This has positive implications for the survival of the species in the light of climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Statistical analyses clearly demonstrated that the three species largely overlapped in centroid size (M. erythroleucus tends to be larger on average than the M. huberti and M. natalensis) but they exhibited large differences in skull shape. The current study focused on skull shape, and allowed us to discriminate three morphological groups that are congruent with the three species suggested by molecular identification (90\% of the individuals are correctly assigned by cross-validated classifications). In the Mastomys, the evolution of cranial length and shape may be influenced by competitive pressure between closely related species separated by ecological segregation.

	issn = {0375-0442},
	abstract = {Mammalian fossils have been collected over several decades by teams associated with the Kenya National Museums from two sites ill northwestern Kenya, Losodok and Benson's Site. Geological work in the area has determined that Losodok is Late Oligocene in age (BOSCHETTO et al. 1992); only one mammal from Losodok has been previously discussed in light of the age determinations, a catarrhine primate (LEAKEY et al. 1995). In this paper, we describe the rest of the mammals known from these sites, which proves to be a fauna consisting of at least 21 species in eight orders. Recent field work during the summer of 2007 yielded more mammals from both of these sites; additional mammal localities were found near Benson's Site, prompting us to designate the new region Nakwal. Several mammalian species are shared between the Losodok sample and that from Nakwal, indicating that they are about the same age. The mammallan faunas are distinctly Oligocene in their taxonomic composition, consisting of African groups previously known from the Early Tertiary such as hyracoids, arsinortheres, primitive proboscideans, thryonomyold rodents, proviverrine and pterodontine creodonts, catarrhine Primates, and anthracotheres. immigrant mammals characteristic of the African Early Miocene are conspicuously absent except for a small true carnivore of the genus Mioprionodon, the earliest fossil record of Carnivora in Africa. We formally describe two new genera (Losodokodon, a proboscidean, and Mlanyama, a creodont), and 8 new species (of the genera Brachyhyrax, Thyrohrax, Meroechyrax, Diamantomys, Mioprionodon, and the two new genera). Several other species are informally described and discussed but not named in this paper, and we also make new comparisons regarding Kamoyapithecus, the only species from Losodok previously named (LEAKEY et al. 1995). The new fauna is transitional between earlier Oligocene mammal faunas of Africa (known from Ethiopia, Egypt, and several other countries) and the Early Miocene faunas of East Africa. Several taxa are morphological intermediates, and potential phylogentic links, between early Tertiary forms and Miocene taxa; these include the proboscidean Losodokodon and the primate Kamoyapithecus. Others represent the earliest record for African groups otherwise known in the Miocene (Brachyhyrax, Afrohyrax, Meroehyrax, Prodeinotherium, Diamantomys). Still others represent the latest occurrence of taxa previously known from the Early Tertiary (pachyhyracinc hyracoids, Thyrohyrax, Arsinoitherium). All taxa in the fauna represent forms that could have evolved in situ in Africa except for the new species of Mioprionodon, which is an immigrant from the north. The new discoveries highlight the fact that the faunal transition between archaic endemic mammals of the Early Tertiary and the more modern Neogene faunas occurred during a very short time interval at or near the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. We discuss the nature and importance of this transition, which we designate the African Mid-Tertiary Event (AMTE).},

	abstract = {As small arid-zone mammals, Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) are unusual in being diurnally active. It is postulated that they remain active during the day by using their parasol-like tails to shade their bodies whilst foraging. However, no studies have continuously measured body temperature to determine the effect of using the tail as a parasol, relative to other thermoregulatory behaviours, such as burrow retreat. We caught four free-ranging Cape ground squirrels (673 [plus or minus] 36 g) and surgically implanted miniature temperature-sensitive data loggers into their abdomens, to record body temperature every 5 min to an accuracy of 0.04 [degree]C, before they were released back into their home range and observed for two weeks. Mean daily peak black globe temperature was 41 [degree]C, and daily peak body temperature reached 40 [degree]C. Ground squirrels raised their tails significantly more often at globe temperatures above 30 [degree]C, but raising the tail did not decrease body temperature, nor prevent body temperature rising. Ground squirrels retreated to burrows, at 18 [degree]C, significantly more often at high body temperatures and body temperature dropped 1-2 [degree]C before reemergence. We believe that the tail was raised to provide thermal comfort during high solar radiation exposure, and that burrow retreat was employed to dissipate a heat load and remain active diurnally.

It is represented by two young adults, a female (holotype) and male (paratype), obtained from two sites in the central Congo Basin, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The new species is the possible morphological and phylogenetic counterpart of G. crassicaudatus, endemic to West Africa. Although the new species resembles G. crassicaudatus in texture and coloration of pelage, along with certain derived cranial features, G. walterverheyni, n. sp., is separated not only by its much smaller body size as evidenced by the significant contrasts in external, cranial, and dental metrics between the two species, but also by proportional differences. The South Central faunal region of equatorial Africa (Grubb, 1978, 1982, 2001; Colyn, 1991; Colyn and Van Rompaey, 1994; Happold, 1996), and the Salonga-Lukenie-Sankuru landscape (Congo Basin Forest Partnership, 2006). identify the biogeographic landscape of G. walterverheyeni, n. sp. Scant habitat information associated with the specimens suggests that this Congo Basin endemic occurs in seasonally flooded tropical lowland forest formations. Two other species of Graphiurus, G. lorraineus and G. surdus, are broadly sympatric with the new species, but neither has been recorded from the two collection localities. Determining species diversity of sub-Saharan dormice embraces epidemiological concerns in addition to strictly taxonomic and biogeographic inquiries. The first documented outbreak of human monkeypox outside Africa occurred in the midwestern United States in 2003 and was associated with a shipment of captive mammals (Funisciurus sp., Heliosciurus sp., Cricetomys sp., Atherurus sp., Hybomys sp., and Graphiurus sp.) from Ghana (Guarner et. al., 2004). Following this outbreak, certain species of African dormice occurring in West and Central Africa are currently being scrutinized as possible hosts of monkeypox virus (Orthopoxviridae), which can produce a severe illness in humans resembling smallpox (Hutson et al., 2007; Levine et al., 2007). Understanding the ecology and epidemiology of this virus requires correct identification of mammalian host species so that accurate, relevant geographic and ecological data can be analyzed.},

We examined the dynamics of hybridization between a trematode parasite of humans, Schistosoma mansoni, and its sister species, S. rodhaini, a rodent parasite, in a natural hybrid zone in western Kenya. Using microsatellite markers, rDNA and mtDNA, we showed that hybrids between the two species occur in nature, are fertile and produce viable offspring through backcrosses with S. mansoni. Averaged across collection sites, individuals of hybrid ancestry comprised 7.2\% of all schistosomes collected, which is a large proportion given that one of the parental species, S. rodhaini, comprised only 9.1\% of the specimens. No F1 individuals were collected and all hybrids represented backcrosses with S. mansoni that were of the first or successive generations. The direction of introgression appears highly asymmetric, causing unidirectional gene flow from the rodent parasite, S. rodhaini, to the human parasite, S. mansoni. Hybrid occurrence was seasonal and most hybrids were collected during the month of September over a 2-year period, a time when S. rodhaini was also abundant. We also examined the sex ratios and phenotypic differences between the hybrids and parental species, including the number of infective stages produced in the snail host and the time of day the infective stages emerge. No statistical differences were found in any of these characteristics, and most of the hybrids showed an emergence pattern similar to that of S. mansoni. One individual, however, showed a bimodal emergence pattern that was characteristic of both parental species. In conclusion, these species maintain their identity despite hybridization, although introgression may cause important alterations of the biology and epidemiology of schistosomiasis in this region.},

Foraging efficiency was determined by measuring the remaining food in artificial food patches (giving-up densities: GUDs) from two experiments. in the first experiment, we placed patches in different microhabitat types (cover vs open) and at varying distances from cover. This experiment was conducted during three moon stages (waxing, full, waning). We found that the rodents had higher GUDs (lower foraging efficiency) in the open microhabitat. The distance from nearest shelter had a marginally significant positive effect on GUDs. GUDs were higher in both microhabitat types during the waxing and full phases, but decreased sharply once the moon began to rise after sunset. These results are likely due to higher predation risk away from cover and in more illuminated environments. In the second experiment, we examined mouse responses to seeds impregnated with plant toxins. Seeds impregnated with oxalic acid were avoided by the rodents, while seeds soaked in tannic acid did not differ significantly from control seeds. Our results highlight important ecological factors affecting the foraging behaviour of these rodents.},

Nineteen environmental variables submitted to a Principal Components Analysis selected those variables with higher factor loadings, which represent the main environmental conditions of the Northern African region (temperature in the coldest quarter, seasonal temperature, precipitation in the coldest quarter, temperature in the wettest quarter). After selecting hundred times more pseudo-absence points than presence observations (n = 6600 at a 0.083[degree] resolution), Generalized Additive Models and Single-hidden-layer Neural Networks fitted in R were used to calibrate the model. Model results were extrapolated for the Canary Islands and the western Mediterranean region. In order to select between the two techniques, we calculated three accuracy measures (specificity, sensitivity and AUC) after using a Jack-knifing procedure and models were repeated ten times. The GAM model was less accurate than the NN model. Suitable areas did not have mean temperatures in the coldest quarter lower than -5[degree]C and precipitation in the coldest quarter higher than 300 mm, respectively. We predicted favorable climatic areas across almost all the Maghreb, the European western Mediterranean region and in all the Canary Islands. Nevertheless, the seven islands differed significantly in the mean favorability scores, with El Hierro, Lanzarote and Gran Canaria being the most suitable. Same methodological analysis was applied to predict A. getulus distribution in other Canarian islands based on presence data from the invaded Fuerteventura. In this case, only Lanzarote and Gran Canaria appeared to be climatically suitable for the species. Our predictive model is an applicable tool to establish the invasive potential of A. getulus and to prioritize management strategies, within and outside the Canarian archipelago, to impede the expansion of this invasive squirrel out of Fuerteventura Island.},

To improve our taxonomic knowledge on this subgenus and its distribution range in West Africa, we performed a molecular, cytogenetical and morphological study of all Mus ( Nannomys) species in this part of Africa. This approach allowed us to detect five species in Guinea (Mus mattheyi, M. minutoides, M. setulosus, M. baoulei, M. musculoides) and four ( M. minutoides, M. setulosus, M. baoulei, M. musculoides) in Ivory Coast. Our molecular results confirm the validity of M. baoulei and the extended distribution range of M. mattheyi. We also observed a high degree of genetic differentiation between and within these species, especially within the M. setulosus clade which may be a species complex. The canonical analyses on the craniometrical and external morphological features of the sequenced specimens are insufficient to perfectly separate the studied species. Nevertheless, our results confirm that M. setulosus and M. baoulei are the largest Mus species that occur in Guinea and Ivory Coast. M. baoulei can be distinguished by its short tail and M. setulosus by an enlarged and bilobated lower molar (M3). Among the smaller species, M. musculoides is difficult to identify using morphological data alone, but differences in tail length proportions, size of tympanic bullae, the length and shape of the upper dental row allow identification of this species with some confidence.

	abstract = {In grassland systems across the globe, ecologists have been attempting to understand the complex role of fire, grazing and rainfall in creating habitat heterogeneity and the consequences of anthropogenic control of these factors on ecosystem integrity and functioning. Using a South African grassland ecosystem as a model, we investigated the impact of fire and grazing pressure on small mammal communities during three differing periods of a rainfall cycle. Over 2 years, 15,203 trap nights revealed 1598 captures of 11 species (nine rodents, one macroscelid and one insectivore). Results highlighted the importance of the interplay between factors and showed that the role of fire, grazing and rainfall in determining small mammal abundance was species-dependant. While no two species were affected by the same environmental variables, grass cover or height was important to 56\% of species. Considered independently, high rainfall had a positive influence on small mammal abundance and diversity, although the lag period in population response was species-specific. High grazing negatively affected overall abundance, but specifically in Mastomys coucha; fire alone had little immediate impact on small mammal diversity. Six months after the fire, vegetation cover had recovered to similar levels as unburned areas, although small mammal diversity and richness were higher in burned areas than unburned areas. Grazing levels influenced the rate of vegetation recovery. In conclusion, low-level grazing and burning can help to maintain small mammal biodiversity, if conducted under appropriate rainfall levels. A too high grazing pressure, combined with fire, and/or fire conducted under drought conditions can have a negative impact on small mammal biodiversity. To maintain small mammal diversity in grassland ecosystems, the combined effects of the previous year's rainfall and existing population level as well as the inhibition of vegetation recovery via grazing pressure need to be taken into consideration before fire management is applied.},

We investigated pituitary function to assess whether there was reproductive inhibition at the level of the pituitary and potentially the hypothalamus in breeding and non-breeding female Cape ground squirrels. We did so during the summer and winter periods by measuring luteinizing hormone (LH) responses to single doses of 2g exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and physiological saline administered to 42 females from II colonies. Basal LH concentrations of females increased in response to the GnRH challenge. Basal plasma LH concentrations were greater during winter, when most oestrus events are observed. However, we found no differences in plasma LH concentrations between breeding and non-breeding females. We showed that the anterior pituitary of non-breeding female ground squirrels is no less sensitive to exogenously administered GnRH than that of breeding females. We therefore concluded that the pituitary is no more active in breeding than non-breeding females. The lack of differentiation in response to GnRH suggests that either non-breeding females have ovaries that are less sensitive to LH or that they refrain from sexual activity with males through an alternative mechanism of self-restraint.},

	abstract = {Our earlier chromosome banding studies of Acomys cahirinus and Acomys dimidiatus (the latter long considered to be a subspecies of the former) revealed that, despite very close diploid numbers (36 vs. 38), these taxa possess sharply different karyotypes and undoubtedly belong to different species. In this context, the taxonomic status and the relationship between the two chromosomal forms in Sinai (2n = 36) and Israel (2n = 38), chromosomally homozygous across a vast range except for a very narrow hybrid zone, remain poorly documented. Neither of these forms have previously been studied by chromosome banding; thus, the exact nature of chromosomal differences as well as the species to which these forms should be assigned remain unknown. Here, we present the data on comparative G-banding analysis and morphometrics of Acomys from Israel, Sinai, and Saudi Arabia, and a hybrid obtained in laboratory crosses between latter two. The analysis revealed that karyotype of Acomys from Israel is identical to that of Acomys from Saudi Arabia and both are different from that of Acomys from Sinai by one Robertsonian fusion. Therefore, karyotypically, all three are very different from A. cahirinus. It follows from the study that Sinai and probably Arabian peninsula and Minor Asia must be excluded from geographical distribution of A. cahirinus, which is limited from West Sahara to Egypt along Nile river (except Sinai). Furthermore, the synthesis of chromosomal and recent molecular data suggests a phylogeographical scenario explaining the modern distribution of Acomys in the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas and permits the update of the taxonomic status of these populations.

	abstract = {One way to avoid potential predators is to be sensitive to odour cues, particularly those in faeces and urine, left by predators. This sensitivity has been demonstrated in many solitary, nocturnal, small mammals which may fall victim to ambush predators. We tested the response of Cape ground squirrels, a diurnal, group-living small mammal, to the presence of predator (black-backed jackal) faeces and non-predator (black wildebeest) dung in baited traps, and also predator faeces and non-predator dung outside their burrows. The squirrels showed a significantly higher avoidance of traps scented with predator faeces than both control and non-predator dung-scented traps. They also took significantly longer to emerge from burrows that had predator faeces outside compared with control burrows and burrows with non-predator dung outside and showed a trend for higher vigilance once they emerged from burrows with predator faeces outside. We argue that as diurnal group-living reduces a reliance on olfactory cues, this species is more likely to rely on visual cues and the vigilance of other individuals than nocturnal solitary species that have been the focus of most studies up till now. As a result, squirrels very quickly return to normal behaviour after exposure to a predator cue. Level of sociality is likely to influence responses to olfactory cues of predators and should be the focus of further studies.},

Our study revealed that 17 rearrangements comprising seven fissions, five translocations and five inversions occurred in the evolution of this group, with 1 - 13 rearrangements differentiating the various species. In addition the unusually large sex chromosomes appear to be species- specific as judged by size and morphology reflecting structural rearrangements as well as the variable presence of a large amount of C-heterochromatin found in each species at a particular chromosomal location. These karyotypic features allow us to recognize five distinct species in West Africa ( compared to the two recognized in recent taxonomic lists) and to roughly delimit their geographical distributions. The pattern of phylogenetic relationships inferred from a cladistic analysis of the chromosomal data is in good agreement with recent molecular phylogenetic studies that recognize a West African species group within the genus Gerbilliscus, and the monophyly of both Gerbilliscus and Gerbillurus.

	abstract = {The genus Arvicanthis Lesson, 1842 (Rodentia; Muridae; Murinae) comprises herbivorous unstriped grass rats widespread in the Nile Valley and West, Central and East Africa. Two species (A. niloticus and A. testicularis) have previously been reported to occur in the Nile Valley but with many taxonomic uncertainties. This investigation was aimed at clarifying the systematic position of these two putative species in Sudan by using cytogenetic data and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (PCR-RAPDs) fragments. Karyological comparisons of the two putative species, captured in six different regions of Sudan, revealed the existence of one species, A. niloticus, with a diploid number of 2n = 62 and N.F.A = 62, identical to karyotyped populations from northeastern Africa (Egypt and Ethiopia), which belong to the known cytotype ANI-1a. The PCR-RAPD protocol used in this study was shown to be consistent, reproducible and highly informative. Analysis of the genetic profiles of samples showed no separation of Arvicanthis individuals into "species" or populations (divergence range = 0.05 - 0.19\%). Furthermore, t-tests revealed that intra-population divergences were significantly higher than inter-population values (two-tailed t-test for unequal variances; 0.001 {\textless} P {\textless} 0.05), indicating that genetic variation is not structured geographically. The data obtained from the two systematic methods suggest the absence of reproductive isolation and it therefore appears more appropriate to consider Arvicanthis from Sudan to represent a single species, namely A. niloticus.},

	volume = {21},
	issn = {0932-9153},
	abstract = {In the 19th, and at the beginning of the 20th century, Collared Flycatchers Ficedula albicollis Were probably always sparsely distributed in SW Germany. In the state and communal forests of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the rise in the number of nest boxes from 0 to over 200.000 in the 25 years after 1950 triggered an enormous population increase to about 5.000-7.000 breeding pairs. A slight rise in numbers had already been recorded obviously due to the high numbers of cold winters in the period 1930-1971. since the resulting decline in competing species benefited the Collared Flycatcher. With stagnation in the number of boxes the population began to decline. The population increase in meadow orchards was similar and was perhaps influenced by the high population increase in woodland. But while there was only a temporary drop in the meadow orchard population due to climatic factors in Africa (Sahel drought) in 1970-1990, the forest population has almost disappeared. The factors suggested as possible causes of the population fall since ca. 1975 included an "Atlanticisation" of the breeding season climate in Central Europe, the effects of toxic substances used in forests and meadow orchards, the grubbing up of fruit trees, or the loss of mature forest stands. None of these factors appears to have played a decisive role in the drop in numbers. Although mature tree stands, and therefore natural cavities, have increased over the last 50 years, the flycatcher nearly disappeared from woodland. However the ca. 5 million nest box records from the forests of Baden-Wurttemberg highlight a phenomenon that until now has been almost ignored. This population decrease in woodland has, for over 20 years, run counter to the increase in the numbers of the Edible Dormouse Glis glis. Around 1950, this species occupied between 2 and 7 \% of nest boxes: today that figure is 20-30 \%, but regionally can be well above 70 \%. During the first 25 years of nest box monitoring, Edible Dormice found in nest boxes were killed. While this dormouse's active period hardly overlaps with the breeding season of tits Parus spp. and Nuthatch Sitta europaea, it clashes completely with that of the flycatcher. Through competition for nest boxes and predation on birds. both young and adults, it has become the dominant factor. Following an "Edible Dormouse year" there are Ficedula albicollis population declines in the two subsequent years. leading in the medium-term to elimination of subpopulations and a reduction in breeding range. Declining interest in the hunting of Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes, plus oral vaccination against rabies, have led to a huge rise in the fox population. In forests this has meant a reduction in the numbers of martens Martes spp., even though they are also hunted less, which in turn has profited the Edible Dormouse. Now increasing numbers of competitors in the forests are diminishing the supply of cavities. Of all successful breeding attempts by birds, the percentage represented by Collared Flycatcher in the forests of SW Germany fell from regional values of 3-30 \% to present-day levels that can barely be measured. Only a local trial since 1999 to encourage flycatchers in the forests by preventing the settlement and reproduction of Edible Dormouse has resulted in a strong improvement in Ficedula albicollis numbers, and its share of all successful birds breeding in nest boxes rose (despite unfavourable climatic developments at 700 m a.s.l.) from an average of below 2 \% to 33 \%. The almost complete exclusion of a single competitor/predator has therefore led to a substantial in-crease in the Collared Flycatcher population. The Edible Dormouse, which is uncommon away from woodland, is almost certainly the chief cause for the disappearance of Collared Flycatchers from SW-German forests, which, with their increasingly semi natural management regime and their rising mast crop, are proving to be an ecological trap for the species. Also their preference for alluvial woodland might be explained by the fact that dormice that hibernate underground are drowned. So what can be singled-out here over the past 70 years is that the weight given to the dominant factors affecting Collared Flycatcher numbers at different times has frequently altered: Periods with an above average number of cold winters decimated competing cavity-breeders like tits and Nuthatch between 1930 and 1970. From 1950 to 1970 the erection of a huge number of nest boxes and the killing of Edible Dormice resulted in Collared Flycatcher being a common woodland bird species. Simultaneously, toxic substances in the environment have apparently affected predators (Sparrow hawk Accipiter nisus) and cavity-competitors (wasps, hornets, bats; Vespidae, Chiroptera) more than the flycatcher, and hence it has even becoming re-established in woodlands. Studies confirm this (Tab. 2), but also show that the former high numbers of this flycatcher were artificially maintained. The strong recovery trend in flycatcher numbers since the 1990s were only seen in the meadow orchards. where the species profited from the decline of its cavity-competitors Tree Spar-row Passer montanus and Starling Sturnus vulgaris and the absence of Edible Dormice.},

A total of 2170 individuals, spread over 16 rodent species, were caught in a capture-mark-recapture study which covered both the dry and wet seasons. The more humid site (Tabora B) in the northern part of Serengeti had the highest diversity of rodents followed by the Mihale site at the western extension. The driest site at Robanda had the lowest overall species diversity. Diversity also varied between the three levels of conservation status whereby the UA had the least diversity while the NP, which enjoyed the highest level of conservation status, had the highest diversity of rodents. Unprotected Area and NP plots at Tabora B showed a rodent species similarity index of 40\%; all the other paired plots scored over 50\% similarity indices, suggesting that, within a site, species composition did not vary significantly between the three levels of conservation status. The Robanda site had the highest (56\%) overall abundance of rodents; Mihale and Tabora B sites had about the same level of rodent abundance (20 and 24\% respectively). For the Mihale site, Mastomys natalensis ranked first followed by Arvicanthis niloticus and Tatera robusta, each of which contained 40, 38 and 16\%, respectively, of all individuals caught at the site. For the Robanda site, the figures were 66\%A. niloticus, 22\%M. natalensis and 9\%T. robusta; while for the Tabora B site the scores were 37\%M. natalensis, 18\%T. robusta and 11\%Lemniscomys barbarus. The differences in diversity, species composition and population abundance appear to result largely from physiognomic vegetation types, and habitat perturbations caused by livelihood activities in Western Serengeti.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the usefulness of two mitochondrial genes (16S rRNA and cytochrome b) to solve taxonomical difficulties within the genus Hylomyscus and to infer its evolutionary history. Both genes proved to be suitable molecular markers for diagnosis of B Hylomyscus species. Nevertheless the resolving powers of these two genes differ, and with both markers (either analyzed singly or in combination), some nodes remain unresolved. This is probably related to the fact that the species emerged during a rapid diversification event that occurred 2-6 Myr ago (4-5 Myr ago for most divergence events). Our molecular data support the recognition of an "aeta" group, while the "alleni'" and "parvus" groups are not fully supported. Based on tree topology and genetic divergence, two taxa generally recognized as subspecies should be elevated at the species level (H. simus and H. cf kaimosae). H. stella populations exhibit ancient haplotype segregation that may represent currently unrecognized allopatric species. The existence of cryptic species within H. parvus is questioned. Finally, three potentially new species may occur in West Central Africa. The Congo and Oubangui Rivers, as well as the Volta and Niger Rivers and/or the Dahomey gap could have formed effective barriers to Hylomyseus species dispersal, favoring their speciation in allopatry. The pronounced shifts in African climate during the late Pliocene and Miocene, which resulted in major changes in the distribution and composition of the vegetation, could have promoted speciation within the genus (refuge theory). Future reports should focus on the geographic distribution of Hylomyscus species in order to get a better understanding of the evolutionary history of the genus. [copyright] 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Numerous studies have compared the efficiency of different types of traps for the survey of small mammals in temperate Countries, but such comparative studies are strikingly fewer in tropical habitats. We compared the efficiency of three types of traps for sampling small mammals in an African rainforest : one type of interception trap (pitfall traps with drift fences) and two types of baited traps (Sherman live trap and metal snap trap). We captured 1884 individuals belonging to 9 shrew and 11 murid rodent species. Pitfall traps were more efficient (higher number of species trapped and higher trap success) than baited traps for capturing shrews. In contrast, they were less efficient for capturing rodents, even if some rare species were captured in pitfall traps only. Sherman and snap traps have complementary qualities for the capture of rodents. Sherman traps are more effective for trapping smaller rodent species, while snap traps tend to be more effective for trapping larger ones. Moreover, light individuals of the largest species are better captured than heavy ones in Sherman, while no significant difference was observed for small species. No sex ratio difference was detected between populations sampled by each of the three types of traps. The three types of traps used in this study have complementary effects onto the capture of small mammals in African rainforest. An assortment of traps should always be employed in studies of small mammal communities in African rainforest in order to obtain a wider range of taxa, and thus a better representation of the community.},

	abstract = {The palaeontological site of Hoedjiespunt 1 (HDPI) has been dated to the late Middle Pleistocene. The rich mammalian fauna, recovered from the site, including four hominid teeth, is believed to have been accumulated by a hyaena. Micromammals were recovered from within the same horizons as the macro fauna. Previous analyses of the micromammals from the hyaena lair did not include a taphonomic analysis, and the agent of accumulation was assumed to be the hyaena responsible for the accumulation of the larger mammals. This assumption had not, however; been verified by a taphonomic analysis of the micromammal assemblages. A taxonomic and taphonomic study was thus carried out on the HDPI micromammals in order to identify the predator(s) or agents responsible for the micromammal accumulation, and to evaluate the suitability of the assemblage for palacoenvironmental analysis. The general pattern of species distribution of the murids from the two main fossil-bearing horizons at Hoedjiespunt I suggests that the micromammals have come from the same, original assemblage. The similarity observed in the micromammal taxonomy of these horizons is echoed in the taphonomy. The digestion on prey incisors, together with the range and activity patterns of prey species, suggests that the predator responsible for the fossil accumulation was a barn owl. The assemblage may provide a brief window into the micromammal population living on the west coast, in the immediate vicinity of the site, during the late Middle Pleistocene.},

Late Pleistocene specimens of Mus from the fossil-bearing locality of Doukkala If near Rabat (Morocco) belong to a species that can be recognised as very close to M. spretus. This species likely settled in North Africa before the house mouse at a date that is still unknown.},

Nokis are diurnal and, compared to nocturnal small mammals, are relatively easy to observe, yet few field studies have been completed. Using radio-tracking and direct observation, a population of nokis in Namibia was intermittently studied over 3 years to document their basic natural history. Temperature loggers and temperature-sensitive radio tags were used to determine that nokis do not have a labile body temperature and do not go into daily torpor. They spend nights deep in rock crevices, but seemingly do not build or use nests. During the cool winter months they bask in the sun at sunrise, and during the heat of the day they shelter in cool rock crevices. During the warm part of the year they bask less frequently. Because nokis have a low relative metabolic rate and a diet of seasonally poor-quality forage, their frequent use of solar basking and passive heat gain and loss from the massive rocks in their habitat is probably related to conservation of energy.},

	abstract = {A description is given of Psittacobrosus bechsteini n. sp. (Menoponidae sensu lato) from a female individual removed from a skin of the Cuban Macaw Ara tricolor, a Cuban endemic extinct since the 19th century. This find provided an opportunity to recall the relationship between ornithology and parasitology established by JOHANN MATTHAEUS BECHSTEIN (1757-1822) at the end of the 18th century. With regard to the listing of (4) scientific animal names created in honour of J. M. BECHSTEIN, it is argued here why the name of the small lepidopteran (Bucculatricidae). 'Bucculatrix bechsteinella (BECHSTEIN \& SCHARFENBERG, 1805)' should be revised as Bucculatrix bechsteinella (SCHARFENBERG in BECHSTEIN \& SCHARFENBERG, 1805). An annotated list identifies the animal louse species regarded as definitely or probably extinct up to the present day, as well as their hosts. It has been claimed that six fossil finds that are dealt with here are all animal lice. in actual fact, this applies to the following three records only: 1. Imagines of Neohaematopinus relictus DUBININ, 1948 (Anoplura, Polyplacidae) ex Spermolegus (Urocitellus) glacialis (VINOGRADOV) (Rodentia, Sciuridae), Pleistocene (ca. 10 000 years old), Yakutskaya. 2. Several eggs of an unknown animal louse (Anoplura ?) on hairs probably from a sciurid-like rodent (Rodentia), Baltic amber, Eocene (ca. 40 million years old), Germany. 3. An imago of Megamenopon rasnitsyni WAPPLER, SMITH \& DALGLEISH, 2003 (Amblycera, Menoponidae sensu lato) perhaps from a procellariiform, charadriiform or anseriform bird. Eocene (40 million years old), Germany. The Cretaceous Saurodectes vrsanskyi RASNITSYN \& ZHERIKHIN, 1999, a presumed ectoparasite on hair-covered pterosaurs, did not belong to the Phthiraptera but to another insect order. Recent (probably) extinct animal lice from mammals are apparently as yet unknown, but in contrast, apart from Psittacobrosus bechsteini n. sp., the following 11 species are known that once parasitized birds. In order of their first description they are: 1. Acutifrons caracarensis (KELLOGG \& MANN, 1912) (lschnocera, Philopteridae s.l.) ex Caracara lutosa (RIDGWAY) (Falconidae).

In North-castern Tanzania, species composition is diverse and includes Mastomys natalensis, Lophuromys flavopunctatus, Grammomys dolichurus, Arvicanthis nairobae, Praomys delectorum and Mus sp.. Five species were recorded in South-western Tanzania namely, M. natalensis, Graphiurus murinus, Saccostomus elegans, Tatera leucogaster and Steatomys pratensis. In Central Tanzania M. natalensis was dominant, but a few Lemniscomys griselda were captured. Rodent abundance fluctuations were distinctively seasonal, especially for M. natalensis in the three localities and T. leucogaster in South-west Tanzania. In North-eastern Tanzania, L. flavopunctatus, G dolichurus, A. nairobae and P delectorum had low, but relatively stable Populations throughout the year. Ill South-west Tanzania, population peaks of M. natalensis and T leucogaster were reached in the dry season (June-September). In Central Tanzania, breeding of M natalensis was seasonal, with highest population abundance during July-November. Female M. natalensis were reproductively active in January-May and males had scrotal testes in December-June. No males were sexually active during July-November. Female T leucogaster in South-western Tanzania were reproductively active during November-April/May whereas sexually active males appeared in the Population during November-March. In view of the observed rodent population fluctuations and breeding patterns, recommendations are given for pragmatic rodent control in South-west and Central Tanzania and for plague in North-eastern Tanzania.},

	abstract = {West African gerbils of the genus Taterillus constitute a complex of seven sibling species distributed from sudano-guinean to saharo-sahelian regions. They display radically rearranged karyotypes despite low genic divergence and a very recent differentiation, that is, within the last 0.4 Myr for the six most derived species. We here provide a comparison of the seven specific karyotypes and perform a cladistic analysis using chromosomal rearrangements character states. When a posteriori polarized mutations were mapped onto the phylogenetic tree, 38 rearrangements were identified as fixed during the evolution of these rodents. This makes Taterillus one of the most striking examples of accelerated chromosomal evolution within placental mammals. Taking into account the types of chromosomal changes involved, divergence times between lineages, genetic distances, as well as reassessed geographic distributions, we suggest that ( 1) speciation in West African Taterillus was driven by chromosomal changes, and ( 2) the paleoclimatic oscillations of the Sahara desert have played a major role in their evolution. In particular, elevated plasticity of the Taterillus genome, as suggested by the patterns observed for some repetitive elements, would have led to a higher probability of mutation. We hypothesize that the process underpinning cladogenesis most probably involved highly underdominant genomic rearrangements that were fixed following pronounced populational bottlenecks resulting from drastic climatic and subsequent environmental changes. Major African rivers formed significant barriers to dispersal, limiting expansion during the more moist and so favorable periods. This scenario would explain the current parapatric species distributions and their relationship to the West African hydrographic features.},

	abstract = {A growing number of studies indicate that females can increase the viability of their offspring by gaining direct benefits such as parental care or genetic advantages through selective mating with certain males. Among the best candidates for the genetic basis of mate choice in vertebrates are the genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) because these highly polymorphic genes may increase offspring viability and provide direct cues for mate choice. A free-ranging, pair-living rodent was used as an example to investigate MHC-dependent mate choice in an obligate monogamous species, the Malagasy giant jumping rat Hypogeomys antimena. Two possible mechanisms of mate choice were tested. First, mate choice may occur to increase the heterozygosity of MHC genes in the progeny and, second, mates might choose each other according to the degree of dissimilarity of their functional MHC DRB (exon 2) proteins in order to maximise the allelic divergence in their offspring. Analyses of 65 Hypogeomys couples failed to confirm associations of mating patterns with the MHC genotype to increase heterozygosity or MHC allelic divergence in the progeny. Also, no evidence for mechanisms to increase the allelic divergence was found in sex-specific analyses where a male or female, respectively, migrated to and was accepted by a territory and burrow holder of the opposite sex. However, the frequency distribution of 0, 1 or 2 new alleles potentially available for the progeny differed significantly when a new male was chosen by a territory-holding female. In contrast to current models, genetically similar instead of dissimilar mates seem to be the preferred choice. This is the first study investigating the role of the MHC in mate selection in an obligate monogamous rodent.},

The present paper follows Vernon ( 1972) and Grindley et al. ( 1973) in eliciting information from material in Barn owl Tyto alba (Scopoli) pellets. Analyses are based on identified and counted mandibles and maxillae. The Laminate vlei rat, Otomys laminatus Thomas and Schwann, and Krebs's fat mouse, Steatomys krebsii Peters, are shown to have wider distributions than were previously recorded. The Southern multimammate mouse, Mastomys coucha ( A. Smith), is apparently expanding its range westwards, a move probably enabled by changes in vegetation due to farming practices. There appears to be some correspondence between proportional representation of some species and rainfall, either its amount per annum or its seasonality. Variation in alveolar length in Cape gerbils, Tatera afra ( Gray), taken as a proxy for mean individual mass, suggests that mean size in this species may be influenced by rainfall seasonality. Although the Vlei rat, Otomys irroratus (Brants), is known to breed throughout the year, the present evidence indicates that in the West Coast National Park births peak in late spring and early summer, some two months after maximum rainfall. The Western Cape data support the concept that T. alba is a selective opportunist. Sample structure and co-occurrence of species in individual pellets both show that in some cases the owls are more nearly opportunistic while in others they appear to be considerably more selective.},

From 18 pigs sampled in the same locations as the patients, PCR showed a high proportion of mixed infections of T. brucei s. l. and T. congolense riverine-forest. Zymodemes of T. brucei s. l. from these pigs were different from those found in humans. From a total of 16 260 captured tsetse (Glossina palpalis palpalis), 1701 were dissected and 28\%, were found to be infected by trypanosomes. The most prevalent trypanosome was T. congolense riverine-forest type, followed by T. Vivax, T. brucei s. l. and T. congolense savannah type, this latter being associated to the forest type of T. congolense in most cases. Mixed infections by 2 or 3 of these trypanosomes were also found. Use of a microsatellite marker allowed us to distinguish T. b. gambiense group I in some of the mature infections in tsetse.

	abstract = {Aim We investigated the patterns of body-size changes of the north-western Mediterranean Plio-Pleistocene large mammal faunas (excluding rodents, bats, lagomorphs and insectivores) in order to identify the tempo and mode of the major shifts in body size distribution, and to put them in the context of Plio-Pleistocene environmental changes and the development of the Mediterranean climate. Location. We analysed fossil faunas of Spain, France and Italy. A set of recent regional faunas from several macroclimatic regions was selected to serve as elements for comparison of the size distribution of past faunas, consisting of: Spain, France and Italy together, Florida, California, Central Chile, Indochina, India, Korea-Manchuria, Malawi, The Cape, North Africa, Turkey and Australia. Methods. Mammal species were grouped into five body size categories for carnivores and four categories for noncarnivore species. The number of species in each size category was computed and the resulting matrix of body weight classes X regions and time intervals was used as an input matrix in a Correspondence Analysis. Results. Recent and fossil faunas strongly differ in body size structure. The distribution of recent faunas within the CA seems to reflect both ecological and historic factors, intertwined in a complex fashion. No clear relationship has been observed between body size structure and environmental factors. During the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene there were only minor changes in the pattern of size distribution, although plant communities were in a transition process from subtropical forests to Mediterranean woodlands and steppes. The major change in body size structure of the north-western Mediterranean fauna occurred at the Galerian, around 1 Ma ago. This marked the beginning of the modern fauna, and a general trend towards a larger body size, reduction in the number of medium sized herbivores, and an increase of large herbivores and megaherbivores. Main conclusions. The Plio-Pleistocene faunas lack modern analogues. The body size structure of mammalian regional faunas appears to be strongly dependent on historical factors. The only major shift in body size distribution occurred during the Plio-Pleistocene, in the late Villaftanchian-Galerian transition, coincident with the onset of the Pleistocene high intensity glacial cycles.},

Although morphologically very similar, they exhibit considerable chromosomal diversity which is here confirmed and extended by the G-banding analysis of 65 mice from West and South Africa. On the basis of their karyotype and distribution area, the specimens were assigned to at least five species. Extensive differentiation both within and between species was observed that involved almost exclusively Robertsonian translocations, 23 of which are newly described. Two of the rearrangements were sex chromosome-autosome translocations, associated in some cases with partial deletions of the X or Y chromosomes. Several authors have predicted that the highly deleterious effect of this rearrangement would be reduced if the sex and autosomal segments were insulated by a block of centromeric heterochromatin. The C-banding analyses performed showed that among the species carrying X-autosome translocations, one followed the expected pattern, while the other did not. In this case, functional isolation of the sex and autosome compartments must involve other repetitive sequences or genomic traits that require further molecular characterization.

For the most abundant species (Hylomyscus stella, Hybomys univittatus, Heimyscus fumosus, and Praomys cf. misonnei), a general unimodal trend in trap success was detected, owing to variations in breeding activity and survival, with a minimum around the long rainy season and a maximum either during the short rainy season or at the beginning of the following long dry season. These fluctuations varied in magnitude among species, and seasonal variations in relative abundance were recorded. Our results support the assumption that in the tropics, rainfall and associated patterns of fruit and insect abundance are important factors which may act directly or indirectly to initiate breeding activity so that lactation occurs at a time of greatest food abundance. Finally, intrapopulational differences in age at sexual maturity were found, both between the sexes and among individuals of the same sex.},

	abstract = {We briefly review the primate-bearing Pondaung mammal fauna (Eocene, Myanmar). The age of the Pondaung fauna has been determined as latest middle Eocene based on the radiometric (fission-track) dates analyzed recently. The Pondaung fauna consists of six orders of mammals, including 22 genera and 29 species. Among the 22 genera, more than half (12 genera) are endemic to this fauna. Although both artiodactyls and perissodactyls are abundant, the former is less diversified in familial and generic numbers than the latter, but is slightly more dominant in collection size [in particular, Anthracotherium (Artiodactyla; Anthracotheriidae) has been most dominantly collected from the field]. This suggests the beginning of the radiation of artiodactyls and decline of perissodactyls in the later Eocene of southern East Asia. Among the Pondaung perissodactyls, brontotheres and amynodonts are dominant in the collection size. The paleoenvironment of the Pondaung fauna is estimated as subtropical/tropical forest with large rivers and patches of open areas near seashore. Among the mammalian genera of the Pondaung fauna, only eight genera were shared with other Eocene faunas of East Asia. On the other hand, the Pondaung fauna shares Anthracotherium with the late Eocene to Oligocene faunas of Europe, and the Pondaung species are more primitive than the European ones. The Pondaung rodent is probably assigned to very primitive phiomyid or anomalurid, both of which had been recorded only in the late Eocene and latter age of Africa/West Asia. These suggest faunal migration from southern East Asia to Africa/West Eurasia during the later Eocene. If the Pondaung primates are really assigned to primitive anthropoids, they might migrate to Africa/West Asia with anthracotheres and/or rodents.},

This revision was realized using craniometric data of nearly 1000 skulls grouped in 20 operational taxonomical units (OTU's) mainly occurring in the central and eastern part of the African continent. The observation that differences in age and sex composition of the OTU's are of no or little consequence for the branching of the obtained phenetic trees, allowed us to undertake the screening of the genus Dasymys of the central and eastern African region. This approach enabled us to evaluate already described taxa, to select a neotype for D. nudipes and to describe three new taxa. Subsequent genetic analysis (cytochrome b) allowed us to provide a genetical characterization of two of the new species and several other taxa. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the genus Dasymys originated in the west African forest block before spreading in a first step to the forest of the central African region and then in a second step to the savannahs of southern, eastern and possibly also western Africa.},

	abstract = {A population and habitat viability analysis (PHVA) was carried out for the Malagasy giant jumping rat (Hypogeomys antimena), one of the key species of the highly threatened dry deciduous forests on the western coast of Madagascar. The occurrence of H. antimena is now confined to 200 km2 of fragmented but relatively undisturbed forest remnants, divided in northern and southern subpopulations. Since 1985 the habitat has declined by about 52\% (1985: 42,000 ha; 2000: 20,000 ha). The annual rate of habitat decline increased from 3.9\% between 1985 and 1995 to 4.4\% between 1995 and 2000. Within a study area (Kirindy Forest/CFPF) in the southern subpopulation, the Hypogeomys population collapsed during the decade 1990-2000, as well as over its remaining range. An ongoing population decline within the next 100 years is predicted even if further habitat decline can be stopped within the next 5 years and no additional mortality by roaming dogs is considered. Thereby, the outcomes of two different individual-based simulation approaches, one that was explicitly written to reflect Hypogeomys life history and VORTEX, one of the most common software packages used for this purpose, were compared. The results of the Hypogeomys model were more pessimistic, but were within the range of predictions of the VORTEX model which calculated larger standard deviations of the mean values. In both subpopulations, a slight increase in the mortality caused by roaming dogs resulted in a predicted decline to an average population size of maximal 170 individuals within 100 years with a high risk of extinction. However, the simulations indicated that the most important factor is reduction in habitat. If the actual annual rate of habitat lost continues, the extinction of the both subpopulations and therefore the entire species is predicted within 24 years.},

Here we report that individuals can live a very long time: many are alive after more than 20 years and some are 26 years old (and counting).

Little is known about the biology of these canids, especially the physiological mechanisms that contribute to their ability to live in such harsh environments. For individuals from Saudi Arabia, we tested the hypotheses that Ruppell's foxes have a reduced basal metabolic rate and total evaporative water loss (TEWL), parameters measured in the laboratory, and a reduced field metabolic rate (FMR) and water flux when free-living. Under basal conditions in the laboratory, males, which averaged 1,858 g in body mass, had an oxygen consumption of 914.9 mL O2/h, whereas females, which weighed on average 1,233 g, consumed 682.9 mL O2/h; rates of oxygen consumption translated to 441.4 kJ/d and 329.4 kJ/d, respectively. TEWL averaged 52.6 g H2O/d for males and 47.5 g H2O/d for females. We found no evidence that basal metabolism is reduced in Ruppell's foxes, but their TEWL was remarkably low: 50.9\% of allometric prediction for males and 64.5\% for females. In the wild during winter, males expended energy at a rate of 1,306.5 kJ/d, whereas females had an expenditure of 722.8 kJ/d. Analysis of covariance with FMR as the dependent variable, sex as a fixed factor, and body mass as a covariate showed no statistical difference in FMR between sexes. Water flux did not differ significantly between sexes and averaged 123 mL H2O/d, a value 30\% lower than the kit fox from the deserts of southwestern North America. FMR was positively related to nocturnal activity levels as FMR (kJ/d)=-2,900.1+55.5 (\% of time moving). The water content of prey items varied between 1.9 and 4.1 g H2O/g dry matter consumed.

Our data show that A. agrarius and A. peninsulae are sister species, well-differentiated from other taxa. High genetic distance between A. m. mystacinus and A. m. epimelas leads us to consider them distinct species and sister taxa to other Western Palaearctic species of the subgenus Sylvaemus.

	abstract = {The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encodes a group of closely linked genes that play a central role in the vertebrate immune system. Most natural mammal populations studied so far possess high levels of diversity within the MHC. However, recent investigations in the MHC class II gene DQA of the critically endangered Malagasy giant jumping rat (Hypogeomys antimena) revealed very low variability compared to other mammalian species. The low genetic variability was confirmed in the present study through analyses of the MHC class II gene DRB exon 2. This codes for the antigen-binding site and is therefore considered as one of the most important parts of the MHC. The species' geographic distribution has been reduced recently to a fragmented area of suitable habitat within a geographic range of less than 20[x]40 km of dry deciduous forest at the west coast of Madagascar. H. antimena has some unusual life history characteristics for a rodent species, such as living in obligate monogamy, with pairs staying together until one mate dies, a low reproduction rate (one to two offspring/couple per year), high site and mate fidelity, short dispersal distances, almost no adult migration, and therefore a constant gene pool with very limited gene flow. Current hypotheses usually interpret low MHC polymorphism either as a consequence of reduced selection pressure, bottleneck effects or by constraints of the mating system. To differentiate between these hypotheses, the MHC variability of the DQA and DRB gene of two additional sympatric, but widely distributed rodent species, Macrotarsomys bastardi and Eliurus myoxinus, were studied by using universal primers and single-strand conformation polymorphism. The two species differ in their mating systems: M. bastardi also lives in pairs but E. myoxinus is a promiscuous species. Whereas the investigated MHC class II genes DQA and DRB had low levels of polymorphism in the pair-living species H. antimena and M. bastardi (DQA: 2 and 3 alleles, DRB: 5 and 6 alleles, respectively), higher levels of variation (DQA: 11 alleles, DRB: 9 alleles) were recorded in the promiscuous species, E. myoxinus. Gene diversity was also higher in E. myoxinus (DQA: 0.85, DRB: 0.86) than in the two pair-living species (DQA: 0.41-0.45, DRB: 0.55-0.63). The results suggest that low MHC variability might not only result from bottleneck effects due to recent declines in population size, but also from a monogamous mating system.},

Sequence data were analysed using Distance and Maximum Parsimony phylogenetic reconstruction methods. A minimum spanning network was also calculated. Population genetic structure was determined by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). A (mismatch distribution) analysis was also performed to estimate the patterns of expansion.

Analyses indicate a higher genetic variability for the woodmouse in the Mediterranean peninsulas as compared to northern Europe and the role of these peninsulas as refuge regions for small mammals. A new pattern of postglacial colonisation is also proposed where the Iberian and southern France refuge populations colonised almost all the European regions. The Sicilian population appears to be highly differentiated and highly variable. This result emphasises the importance of this island as a (hot spot) for the intraspecific genetic diversity of the woodmouse. Finally, populations of this species in North Africa originated from south-western Europe and are probably the result of a recent anthropogenic introduction.},

One female showed the diploid number 2n = 24; in the two other individuals, the Rb(9.16) occurred in a heteromorphic condition, and, accordingly, the diploid number was 2n = 25. FISH showed the sites of telomeric sequences at telomeres of all the chromosomes, and in an interstitial position at the centromeres of all Robertsonian metacentrics, except one - the Rb(6.8), though the patterns of hybridization varied between chromosomes. Sex chromosome pairs, in the male and females, showed a similar C-banding pattern, but revealed clear differences after FISH. Traces of telomeric sequences were found dispersed in the whole-heterochromatic arm of the Rb(1.Xd). No visible bond between C-positive heterochromatin and telomeric sequences were detected in the other either bi- or uniarmed chromosomes, indicating that they may actually represent retained telomeres in the Robertsonian metacentrics.},

Field investigations revel that in the industrial zone of Sfax the average Cd content in the kidneys is significantly higher than that in the laboratory controls, animals captured in 40 km north-west of Sfax and animals from Hergla in center of Tunisia. The Cd contamination of the soil and vegetation which constitutes the main food source of Meriones s. shawi accounts partly for these rates. The body weight and serum level of calcium in the animals of these two stations are comparable to those of the laboratory controls. Laboratory investigations of animals of both sexes (n=24) reveal that when 1 g Cd/1 l H2O/1.5 kg granules is added to their diet, the average Cd content in the kidney increases significantly during the treatment: from 0.2 [mu]g/g dry weight in the controls to 103 [mu]g/dry weight after 30 days. However, this content stabilizes in the liver between 20 and 30 days, and in the duodenum between 5 and 30 days treatment. After 30 days of the experimentation, the body weight gain is of 19\% in comparison to the initial weight. It is 3 times less in the supplemented animals. Serum level of calcium decreases significantly after 10 days treatment. All these results show that the kidney of Meriones s. shawi can be considered as the preferential organ for Cd fixation, this metal alters body weight gain and the serum level of calcium. This mammal species would be considered as an indicator of Cd pollution.},

Weaning began as early as 8 days of age, and the age at first reproduction was 6 weeks in males and 5 weeks in females. Compared to its congeners, O. unisulcatus has small litters of semi-precocial young which undergo rapid postnatal development, and contrary to expectations displays several K-selected reproductive characteristics.

Data were also gathered on the ecological characteristics of present cheetah habitats and the status of known and potential cheetah prey species in the area. Impacts of human activities on the cheetah, and on its preys and habitats were also investigated. The results show that the cheetah has disappeared from most of its former range in the northern part of the Egyptian Western Desert. Its entire population has been reduced to what appears to be few individuals confined to a highly inaccessible area in the northern and western parts of the Qattara Depression. These individuals appear to be essentially nomadic, roaming over a vast area of the desert in search of prey. Habitats presently occupied by the cheetah in Egypt include uninhabited oasis depressions within the Qattara Depression. Large groves of Acacia raddiana west and southwest of these habitats appear to be regularly visited by cheetahs. The survey also showed that gazelles, which constitute an important cheetah prey item, have been largely exterminated throughout the study area as a result of uncontrolled illegal hunting, with the exception of a small population which still survives in the western part of the Qattara Depression. Cape hare and several rodent species are numerous throughout present cheetah habitats, and may constitute the main cheetah prey in that area. We compare morphological characters of cheetahs of the Egyptian Western Desert to those of cheetahs from different parts of the world range of A. jubatus. Stringent conservation measures are needed to save this rare and possibly unique population of the cheetah.},

Rattus norvegicus was the highest abundant species in the city (41.9\%) followed by R. rattus (37.2\%), then Mus musculus (20.9\%).

	abstract = {Aim: The modern African murine rodent Oenomys is a semiarboreal genus characteristic of the rain forest zone. The size and shape geographical differentiation is studied in order to discuss the possible evolutionary patterns and constraints leading to this distribution. Location: Two species of Oenomys have been previously recognized, corresponding to the West African forest block on the one hand and to the main forest block on the other hand. Both species have been sampled, and forty localities permit the study of the whole geographical range of Oenomys, from Guinea to Kenya. Methods: A Fourier analysis applied to the outlines of the first upper and lower molars allows a quantification of the size and shape variations across the geographical range of Oenomys. Results: This morphometrical analysis defines three morphological groups of Oenomys, corresponding to the West, Central, and East African forest zone. This result suggests the existence of an additional cryptic species. The Western group is characterized by broad asymmetrical molars and a small size. The Central African group has more elongated and larger molars while the Eastern African group displays extremely constricted molars and a small size. Main conclusion: The shape can be considered as charactheristic of each group and its variations appear to be mostly related to phylogeny while size exhibits variations within each group related to climatic gradients. This discrepancy could be related to different genetic determinants for both characters, the shape being strongly genetically constrained while size can vary according to a wide range of environmental factors.},

Segments of the Y chromosome and of a processed p53 pseudogene (PSIp53) were amplified from many of these mice and from others collected elsewhere in Eurasia and North Africa. The 251 mtDNA types, including 54 new ones reported here, now identified from commensal house mice (Mus musculus group) by sequencing this segment can be organized into four major lineages - domesticus, musculus, castaneus, and a new lineage found in Yemen. Evolutionary tree analysis suggested the domesticus mtDNAs as the sister group to the other three commensal mtDNA lineages and the Yemeni mtDNAs as the next oldest lineage. Using this tree and the phylogeographic approach, we derived a new model for the origin and radiation of commensal house mice whose main features are an origin in west-central Asia (within the present-day range of M. domesticus) and the sequential spreading of mice first to the southern Arabian Peninsula, thence eastward and northward into south-central Asia, and later from south-central Asia to north-central Asia (and thence into most of northern Eurasia) and to southeastern Asia. Y chromosomes with and without an 18-bp deletion in the Zfy-2 gene were detected among mice from Iran and Afghanistan, while only undeleted Ys were found in Turkey, Yemen, Pakistan, and Nepal. Polymorphism for the presence of a PSIp53 was observed in Georgia, Iran, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Sequencing of a 128-bp PSIp53 segment from 79 commensal mice revealed 12 variable sites and implicated gtoreq14 alleles. The allele that appeared to be phylogenetically ancestral was widespread, and the greatest diversity was observed in Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nepal.

Most recent taxonomic revisions list five to six species but the definition of some of these (Arvicanthis dembeensis, Arvicanthis nairobae, and Arvicanthis niloticus) is uncertain. The complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (1140 bp) was sequenced for 20 specimens from throughout the range of the genus to determine the intrageneric genetic structure, construct a molecular phylogeny, and evaluate classical taxonomies. Neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony analyses yielded identical phylogenetic trees that identify two major lineages: the first one (1) is composed of specimens usually referred to A. niloticus but representing several distinct species, and the other (2) is a complex including "true" A. niloticus from Egypt and northern West Africa as well as Arvicanthis abyssinicus, Arvicanthis dembeensis, and Arvicanthis somalicus. An analysis on a 357-bp fragment of the cytochrome b including published data on A. nairobae indicates that this taxon is part of clade (1). Calibration of the number of 3rd position transversion changes with the murid fossil record suggests that clades (1) and (2) diverged approximately 5 Myr ago. Arvicanthis niloticus as currently recognized is a paraphyletic association and this name should be restricted to the Egyptian and northern West African sample. We also suggest referring to A. dembeensis as A. niloticus, as our cytochrome b data do not support its recognition as a distinct species. Clade (1) is subdivided in three lineages, geographically corresponding to southern West, Central, and East Africa. The high genetic divergence detected between the Central African lineage and the other two lineages suggests that they probably represent separate species. Clade (2) experienced rapid cladogenetic events during the late Pliocene, with the A. somalicus lineage being the first to emerge, followed by the ancestor of A. abyssinicus and A.},

	abstract = {Analysis of 904 small carnivore scats collected over a two-year period in a seasonal forest in the southwestern Central African Republic yielded the remains of 732 shrews, rodents ({\textless} 1 kg), and bats comprising at least 34 species. Most scats belonged to the long-nosed mongoose, Herpestes naso, the numerically dominant carnivore in the study area. Shrews were the principal small mammal prey with respect to number of individuals and frequency of occurrence. The mean monthly frequency of occurrence of shrews was 21.7\% and of small rodents ({\textless}100 g) was 20.8\%. Both shrews and small rodents occurred significantly more often in scats collected during dry season months, and live-trapping of rodents over a 22-month period revealed similar peaks in availability. In contrast to many mammalian carnivores, shrews did not appear to be used as an alternative prey source: not only did consumption levels of both prey types fluctuate in synchrony, but the availability of rodents apparently had no effect upon the likelihood of including shrews in the diet. Preferential use of small mammals by long-nosed mongooses was tested for the 10 rodent species for which abundance indices were calculated. Mongooses preyed selectively on several rodent species (Praomys spp., Deomys ferrugineus, Stochomys longicaudatus, and Grammomys rutilans), while the most common rodent in the study area, Hylomyscus spp., was found in scats at lower frequencies than expected. In accordance with the habitat specificities of these 'preferred' rodent prey, it is suggested that mongooses and perhaps other small carnivores were foraging in micro-habitats characterized by higher-than-average vegetation understorey thickness where the simultaneous rate of encounter with arthropods, their main prey, and shrews was apt to be high.},

Staining with DNA dyes showed variation in intensity of fluorescence of the sperm chromatin, with an anterior spherical region staining far more intensely than the surrounding chromatin. Transmission electron microscopy of these spermatozoa indicated that this region was composed of cords and fibres. This chromatin region dispersed more readily than the surrounding chromatin when spermatozoa were incubated with the detergents, and it is suggested that, unlike the rest of the sperm chromatin, it may be a histone-rich region, with protamine(s) being either scarce or absent.},

	abstract = {Hypogeomys antimena, the largest endemic rodent of Madagascar, is exclusively found in a restricted area of less than 1000 km-2 in the deciduous dry forest near the western coast. The facts so far known about its biology, like pair bonds, 1-2 offspring, lack of sexual dimorphism, and the results of a nine-week trapping and radiotracking field study (Cook et al., 1991) suggest monogamy, a rare social system occurring in only 3\% of mammals. By using the same methods of trapping and radiotracking during different seasons, investigations in the proposed social system were carried out and provided a medium-term view of the social structure. The data on Hypogeomys antimena were then used to test hypotheses about the evolution of monogamy in rodents by comparing spacing behaviour and the size of home ranges of males and females before (dry season) and after (rainy season) the birth of offspring. Males and females from neighbouring burrows have similarly-sized but mutually exclusive home ranges. Home ranges of pairs trapped at the same burrows, however, always overlapped extensively. The morphological correlates (no sexual differences in the body measurements, small testes in relation to body size) are those of monogamous species. Pairs remain associated during both breeding and non-breeding periods and pair bonds seem to continue for more than one reproductive season. Offspring stay together with their parents for at least one more year, implying that sexual maturation is probably not reached before the age of two years. The results are consistent with the previous suggestion that Hypogeomys antimena lives in a monogamous social system. Home ranges are larger during the dry season before birth than during the rainy season after the birth of offspring. Pairs with offspring had smaller home ranges than those without. Males tended to stay closer to the offspring than females.},

Lophuromys nudicaudus on the other hand has a zoogeographical distribution covering probably the whole of the West-Central lowland rainforest between the north bank of the Zaire River and the Cross River (Gabon/RioMuni/R.C.A./ Cameroon/ Congo). Since one nudicaudus specimen (KMMA 6251) was collected in Basoko, far to the east of this region, it is probable that further collecting will prove it to be also present in the lowland rainforest on the right bank of the Zaire between the Ubangui and the Aruwimi rivers. Finally, there are indications (1) that specimens from the region between the Cross and Sanaga rivers differ sufficiently from typical nudicaudus to warrant taxonomical recognition under the subspecific name tullbergi and (2) that the Bioko-population, described under the subspecific name parvulus, is very close to its mainland counterpart and should therefore be put into synonymy with tullbergi.},

Elephants used heavily logged areas more than lightly logged and unlogged areas. Forest gaps were used more by elephants than closed-canopy areas and large gaps more than small ones. Gaps were larger in logged than unlogged forest. There were lower densities of young trees (saplings and poles) and a higher incidence of elephant damage to them in heavily logged forest than in lightly logged and unlogged sites. Elephant use of area and damage to young trees was inversely or unrelated to the density of young trees and directly related to the density of herbaceous tangle. Heavy togging resulted in large areas of herbaceous tangle, which attracted elephants who suppressed forest regeneration by damaging voting trees and perpetuating the herbaceous tangle. The tangle directly competed with regeneration of young trees while also attracting elephants and rodents (seed and seedling predators) and facilitating increased windthrow of trees. Selective browsing of young trees by elephants affected rates of regeneration, growth form and species composition. Rather than remove elephants, a more effective and humane approach to long-term management of logging is to reduce logging offtake and incidental damage caused by timber extraction.},

	abstract = {The species composition, and the number of species of mammals, in the Guinea-Congo rain forests varies with locality. The highest species richness (up to 130 species) is found in parts of the West Central and East Central rain forest regions, and the lowest richness occurs in the Western Region and on the periphery of the rain forest zone. Rodents and bats contribute the greatest number of species (about 25\% each), with lesser numbers of primates, duikers, and small insectivores; the relative numbers within each order is similar in all localities regardless of the composition and total numbers of species. The geographical distribution of each species is due to the alternating periods of forest fragmentation and expansion in the past, and the species-specific response to these environmental changes. There are about equal numbers of arboreal (30\%), terrestrial (35\%) and aerial (27\%) species, each species within these categories having very specific habitat requirements within the forest. Most rain forest mammals are either frugivores (36\%) or insectivores (37\%): monkeys are mainly arboreal frugivores and folivores, and most prosimians are arboreal insectivores; forest duikers are terrestrial frugivores, and terrestrial rodents are frugivores or omnivores. Leaves, in spite of their abundance, are rarely eaten because of their low nutritive value and the difficulties of digesting them and consequently folivores (9\%) are uncommon. Insects form the principal food for insect-bats and shrews. Mammals exhibit well-defined food partitioning in relation to food selection and body size, and therefore competition for food is probably minimal except during the dry season. Reproduction is more or less continuous in rodents and artiodactyls (with peaks of births at selected seasons); in contrast, monkeys and bats have fairly precise periods when births occur, which vary according to the species.},

Inglis (1961), studying the syntypes, concluded that the specimens belonged to the some species, which he transferred to Enterobius parallela (Linstow, 1908). After redescription of this species, it appears that these parasites share with the oxyurids in the genus Enterobius a number of morphological characteristics which are common to all the Oxyuridae genera parasites in Primates which consequently does not justify keeping the species in this genus. In addition this species differs from the known species in the genus Enterobius by the following characteristics: pairs 2 and 3 of genital papillae farther from the cloacal opening and surrounded by weak chitinized rings not fusing posterior to cloaca; egg asymmetry less marked; egg non-embryonated and without operculum; lateral alae differently shaped. Finally the parasites of Xerus present original characteristics: genital apparatus prodelphic whereas the general type is amphidelphic; cloacal opening covered by a hood-shaped flap whereas it is a longitudinal slit in all the related taxa; extremity of the spicular pouch protruding from the cloaca; ring-shaped gubernaculum present. Consequently it is proposed to transfer the species to a new genus: Xeroxyuris. The type and only species is Xeroxyuris parallela (Linstow, 1908), parasite of Xerus inauris in South-Africa.},

Both species were diurnal. Galerella did not use dens, whereas Cynictis never rested outside a den. Total distance moved, home range size and density did not differ between the two species. Galerella frequented bush, whereas Cynictis frequented open fields. The yellow mongoose was more social than the grey mongoose, but the basic social structure was similar. Faeces of Cynictis were found in large clumps close to the dens, while those of Galerella were more scattered. This parallels the greater constancy of use of the sleeping sites by Cynictis. Rodents ( gt 90\% of Cape grey mongoose diet) were much more abundant in the bush, while availability of insects (main food source for the yellow mongoose) was higher in the open fields. Habitat selection, through its effects on anti-predator and feeding strategies, might have been the leading factor in the evolution of sociality in herpestids.},

The following results were indicated. (1) Genetic patterns: 11 of the 36 loci analysed (30.5 per cent) were monomorphic across the range, fifteen (41.7 per cent) were weakly polymorphic and the remaining 10 loci (27.8 per cent) were strongly polymorphic. (2) Heterozygosity: the average H was 0.051, range 0.00-0.098. In Israel, H increased with aridity and climatic unpredictability towards the northern Negev Desert, and was remarkably high in small steppic semi-isolates and desert isolates. (3) Species discrimination: some of the S. ehrenbergi species can be discriminated qualitatively. (4) Genetic distances (D): between species these values averaged 0.077, range 0.001-0.269, with the highest D between the ancestor Turkish and descendant Israeli and Egyptian species. The phylogenetic tree supports the Turkish origin of the Israeli Spalax ehrenbergi species, and the recent speciation of the Egyptian Spalax. (5) Genetic diversity is mostly (58 per cent) within populations. (6) Allozyme correlates: allozyme diversity was significantly correlated with the external physical (both climatic and edaphic) and biotic (parasite infection and plant cover) environment. (7) Spatial autocorrelation of allozyme frequencies suggests that migration is not influential. (8) Gametic phase disequilibria were significant in four out of five species tested, and were associated with climatic and edaphic factors. These results support the environmental selection hypothesis of genetic diversity including the niche-width variation hypothesis in space and time.

Positive thick blood smears were recorded in 17.6\% of the 740 rodents and 7.3\% of the 55 musk shrews tested. Variations of prevalence were analyzed in Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys huberti, which represented 62.7\% and 28.3\%, respectively, of the animals captured, and 65.7\% and 27.6\%, respectively, of the animals found infected. Borrelia crocidurae prevalence was significantly different between captures and fluctuated separately for each species. Age-specific prevalence of B. crocidurae showed distinct patterns, decreasing with age from 50\% in younger juveniles to 3\% in older adults for A. niloticus, while increasing with age from 8\% to 23\% for M. huberti. No relationship was observed with animal abundance or with the season of the year for either species. These findings suggest that the diversity of the population dynamics of host-vector-parasite associations in the Sahel region of Senegal may be a key factor for the relative stability of the borreliosis reservoir.},

Arenaviruses are pleomorphic enveloped particles that contain two RNA segments of virus origin and ribosome-like components. Suitable conditions for transmission of virus to humans occur in areas where humans come in contact with rodent urine that contains virus. Persistent viremia and viruria in rodents result from a slow or insufficient immune response when immunologically immature fetuses or neonates are infected. In humans, the disease is acute. There are five pathogens of humans, who are only accidental hosts. Four cause severe hemorrhagic fever with a mortality of about 15 percent among hospitalized patients in circumscribed areas (Lassa virus in West Africa, Junin virus in the Argentine pampas, Machupo virus in Bolivia, and Guanarito virus in Venezuela). The fifth, lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus, is much more widely distributed, but causes milder infections, often neurologic.

The increased frequency of outbreaks and associated high fatality rates of the most prevalent arenavirus, Lassa, in West African countries, highlights the significant risk to public health and to the socio-economic development of affected countries. The devastating impact of these viruses is further exacerbated by the lack of approved vaccines and effective treatments. Differential immune responses to arenavirus infections that can lead to either clearance or rapid, widespread and uncontrolled viral dissemination are modulated by the arenavirus multifunctional proteins, NP and Z. These two proteins control the antiviral response to infection by targeting multiple cellular pathways; and thus, represent attractive targets for antiviral development to counteract infection. The interplay between the host immune responses and viral replication is a key determinant of virus pathogenicity and disease outcome. In this review, we examine the current understanding of host immune defenses against arenavirus infections and summarise the host protein interactions of NP and Z and the mechanisms that govern immune evasion strategies.},

The disease is caused by the Lassa virus, an Old World arenavirus that has as primary reservoir host the multimammate rodent Mastomys nataliensis, which lives in association with humans. Recent estimates suggest LF causes two million cases and 5000-10000 deaths annually, mainly in West Africa. Clinical diagnosis and laboratory confirmation have always been major challenges for effective management and control of the disease in afflicted areas of West Africa. Recent advancements in molecular biology, recombinant DNA technology, and genomics sequencing has facilitated major advancement in development of better diagnostic and surveillance tools for Lassa fever virus. These include, the multiplex, magnetic bead-based immunodiagnostics for both Lassa virus antigens and antibodies; molecular probe-based quantitative real-time PCR for genomic signatures; rapid diagnostics tests that detects the most prevalent West African lineages; and the successful utilization of next-generation sequencing technology to diagnose and characterize Lassa virus in West Africa. These advances will continue to improve disease treatment, control, and prevention. In this review we will discuss progression of Lassa virus diagnostics from the past and into the future.

LF is typically mild but it can cause severe disease characterized by hemorrhagic fever and multi-organ failure. A current outbreak of LASV in Nigeria has seen greater than 300 cases with a case fatality rate of 22\%. Currently, there are limited treatment options and no vaccine candidates are approved to prevent LASV infection. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has identified LASV as an emerging pathogen of high consequence and this has resulted in a push for several preclinical vaccine candidates to be advanced toward clinical trials. Here, we discuss several important aspects of LASV infection including immunobiology, immune evasion, and correlates of protection against LF, which have been identified through animal models and human infections. In addition, we discuss several vaccine candidates that have shown efficacy in animal models that could be advanced toward clinical trials. The increased fatality rate seen in the recent LASV outbreak in Nigeria highlights the importance of developing effective treatment and prevention strategies against LF. The spike in LASV cases seen in West Africa has the potential for increased mortality and human-to-human transmission, making the development and testing of effective vaccines for LASV critical.},

	abstract = {Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is a zoonotic disease caused by several Borrelia species transmitted to humans by Ornithodoros tick vectors. In West Africa, Borrelia crocidurae is a common cause of disease in many rural populations. Small mammals act as reservoirs of infection. We report here the results of surveys that investigated the occurrence of B. crocidurae infection in rodents and insectivores from eight countries of West and Central Africa. Animals were identified at the species level and tested for Borrelia either by examination of thick blood film, intra-peritoneal inoculation of blood or brain tissues into laboratory mice, or by molecular techniques. A total of 4358 small mammals belonging to 38 species and 7 families were collected, including 3225 specimens collected in areas where the occurrence of Ornithodoros sonrai tick in rodent burrows was documented, and 1133 in areas where this tick was absent. In areas with O. sonrai, Borrelia infection was demonstrated in 287 of 3109 (9.2\%) small mammals tested, and none was documented in 1004 animals tested from other areas. There was no relationship between the occurrence of Rhipicephalus, Hyaloma and Argas ticks in burrows and the distribution of Borrelia infection in small mammals. The 287 specimens infected by Borrelia belonged to 15 rodent and shrew species, including three Saharo-Sahelian species - Gerbillus gerbillus, Gerbillus occiduus and Gerbillus tarabuli - identified as reservoirs for TBRF with a distribution restricted to this area. In Sudan and Sudano-Sahelian areas, Arvicanthis niloticus, Mastomys erythroleucus and Mastomys huberti were the main reservoir of infection. Although most small mammals species collected had a large distribution in West and Central Africa, the fact that only animals collected in areas with O. sonrai were found infected suggest that this tick is the only vector of TBRF in rodents and insectivores in this part of Africa.

In this paper, we explored the effects of certainty of diagnosis, oversampling in well-studied region, and error balance on results of mapping exercises. Each of the three factors assessed in this study had clear and consistent influences on model results, overestimating risk in southern, humid zones in West Africa, and underestimating risk in drier and more northern areas. The final, adjusted risk map indicates broad risk areas across much of West Africa. Although risk maps are increasingly easy to develop from disease occurrence data and raster data sets summarizing aspects of environments and landscapes, this process is highly sensitive to issues of data quality, sampling design, and design of analysis, with macrogeographic implications of each of these issues and the potential for misrepresenting real patterns of risk.},

Here, we evaluated BLI as a novel approach for tracking MPX virus infection in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Prairie dogs were affected during a multistate outbreak of MPX in the US in 2003 and have since been used as an animal model of this disease. Our BLI results were compared with PCR and virus isolation from tissues collected postmortem. Virus was easily detected and quantified in skin and superficial tissues by BLI before and during clinical phases, as well as in subclinical secondary cases, but was not reliably detected in deep tissues such as the lung. Although there are limitations to viral detection in larger wild rodent species, BLI can enhance the use of prairie dogs as an animal model of MPX and can be used for the study of infection, disease progression, and transmission in potential wild rodent reservoirs.},

After having collected molecular evidence of an indigenous African hantavirus in 2006, an intensive investigation for new hantaviruses has been started in small mammals. Various novel hantaviruses have been molecularly identified not only in rodents but also in shrews and bats. In addition, the first African hantavirus, Sangassou virus, has been isolated and functionally characterized in cell culture. Less is known about the ability of these hantaviruses to infect humans and to cause diseases. To date, no hantavirus genetic material could be amplified from patients' specimens collected in Africa. Serological studies in West Africa, based on a battery of screening and confirmatory assays, led to the detection of hantavirus antibodies in the human population and in patients with putative hantavirus disease. In addition to this overview, we present original data from seroepidemiological and field studies conducted in the Southern part of Africa. A human seroprevalence rate of 1.0\% (n=1442) was detected in the South African Cape Region whereas no molecular evidence for the presence of hantavirus was found in 2500 small animals trapped in South Africa and Namibia.

PBMC from healthy human subjects were exposed to either LASV or ML29. Although most PBMC are non-permissive for virus replication, they remain susceptible to signal transduction by virus particles. Total RNA was extracted and global gene expression was evaluated during the first 24 hours using high-density microarrays. Results were validated using RT-PCR, flow cytometry and ELISA. LASV and ML29 elicited differential expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), as well as genes involved in apoptosis, NF-kB signaling and the coagulation pathways. These genes could eventually serve as biomarkers to predict disease outcomes. The remarkable differential expression of thrombomodulin, a key regulator of inflammation and coagulation, suggests its involvement with vascular abnormalities and mortality in Lassa fever disease.},

	abstract = {A number of viruses in the family Arenaviridae cause severe illness in humans. Lassa virus in West Africa and a number of agents in South America produce hemorrhagic fever in persons exposed to aerosolized excretions of the pathogens' rodent hosts. Because arenaviruses are not transmitted by arthropods, and person-to-person spread is rare, human infections occur singly and sporadically, and are usually not diagnosed until the patient is severely ill. Because the arenaviruses are naturally transmitted by the airborne route, they also pose a potential threat as aerosolized bioterror weapons. The broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin was shown to reduce mortality from Lassa fever, and has been tested against Argentine hemorrhagic fever, but it is not an approved treatment for either disease. Human immune convalescent plasma was proven to be effective for Argentine hemorrhagic fever in a controlled trial. New treatments are needed to block viral replication without causing toxicity and to prevent the increased vascular permeability that is responsible for hypotension and shock. In this paper, we review current developments in the experimental therapy of severe arenaviral infections, focusing on drugs that have been tested in animal models, and provide a perspective on future research.},

The virus exhibits persistent, asymptomatic infection with profuse urinary virus excretion in the ubiquitous rodent vector, Mastomys natalensis. Lassa fever is endemic in West Africa and has been reported from Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria. Some studies indicate that 300,000 to 500,000 cases of Lassa fever and 5000 deaths occur yearly across West Africa. Studies reported in English, that investigated Lassa fever with reference to West Africa were identified using the Medline Entrez-PubMed search and were used for this review. The scarcity of resources available for health care delivery system and the political instability that characterise the West African countries would continue to impede efforts for the control of Lassa fever in the sub-region. There is need for adequate training of health care workers regarding diagnostics, intensive care of patients under isolation, contact tracing, adequate precautionary measures in handling infectious laboratory specimens, control of the vector as well as care and disposal of infectious waste.

	abstract = {Lassa fever remains a serious challenge to public health in West Africa threatening both local residents in rural areas and those who serve them, particularly medical care providers. Given the ecology of the rodent host and conditions in the endemic area, a vaccine is mandatory for control. The challenge is to overcome the scientific, political and economic obstacles to producing a human use vaccine candidate. There are some scientific issues to resolve. It is known that the G-protein confers protection but we do not know its duration. If the N-protein is also included there may be a better duration of protection but it is unclear whether the N-protein as a vaccine may possibly enhance the infection. The original vaccinia vector must be replaced by new vectors, chimeras or by delivering DNA in some format. A live vaccine is attractive because it can confer protection in a single shot. A killed vaccine is more stable, particularly for distribution in the tropics but usually requires repeated shots. For practical reasons a live vaccine format should probably be pursued, which could then be combined with a yellow fever vaccine, using the same cold chains, since this disease occupies the same endemic areas in West Africa. Lassa vaccine initiatives have suffered from a lack of funding in the past but bioterrorism has brought new resources to Lassa virus science. Adequate funding and applications of new vaccine technologies give hope that we may soon see a vaccine in clinical trials. However, the difficulty of conducting trials in endemic areas and lack of political stability remain serious problems. [References: 61]},

	abstract = {Since 1996, there have been reports of cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the town of Ouagadougou. The incidence has been on the rise but precise figures are not known. The object of the present study has been, first, to record cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis having occurred in private and public health centres in Ouagadougou from 1996 to 1998 and, second, to determine the progression of the disease in space and time. We wished also to confirm clinical cases in 1998 by parasitological examination, identify different clinical forms of the disease and map out cases in the town. We carried out a retrospective study from 1996 to 1998 and a prospective study in 1998. All cases recorded in this period in visited health centres were included. A total of 1845 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis was identified, 50.3\% of whom concerned women. The age of patients varied between 1 and 79 years for 356 patients, with a mean age of 26.7 years. Cases increased between 1996 and 1998 (1996 = 61 cases, 1997 = 552 cases, 1998 = 1218 cases). The months of highest incidence were August (13\%), September (15\%) and October (17\%). Peripheral districts (28, 30, 29, 16, 15) in south-eastern areas of the town were the worst touched with 87\% of cases. On average, patients seek care after 2 months of progression of the disease. The ulcero-crusted form (68.2\%) was the most frequent clinical form observed for 327 patients, but almost half of the cases had more than one site of infection, (43.5\%). Over half of the patients presented fewer than 10 lesions with an average of 6. The most common locations were on uncovered parts of the body, notably the superior (53\%) and inferior limbs (49\%). The parasite could be tested for by smear on 52 patients only in 1998 and 53.8\% of cases tested were positive. Leishmania major, which is very prevalent in West Africa was identified in one patient. The vectors and main reservoirs of the parasite were not studied. Case management was generally incomplete; the most commonly prescribed drugs were antibiotics (70\% of patients), but self-medication was frequent. Our recommendations after this preliminary study are: undertake multidisciplinary studies on cutaneous leishmaniasis in Ouagadougou in order to understand the local aetiology (vectors responsible for transmission, rodent and domestic animals involved in the epidemiological chain, parasite species); identify all other areas in the country where the disease is highly prevalent provide health care staff with a decisional algorithm and protocol therapy carry out and active control programme for cutaneous leishmaniasis in Burkina Faso.},

	abstract = {We have investigated whether naturally induced immunity to Plasmodium falciparum thrombospondin related adhesive protein contributes to protection against malaria in humans. We have carried out a case control study in children living in an endemic region of West Africa to reveal associations between PfTRAP seroprevalence and the risk of cerebral malaria. Sera collected from the case and control groups were analysed by ELISA to compare their serum reactivity against PfTRAP, the circumsporozoite protein and the merozoite surface protein 1. Children with uncomplicated malaria had a significantly higher PfTRAP seroprevalence when compared to children with cerebral malaria. The risk of developing cerebral malaria appeared to depend on the reciprocal relationship between sporozoite inoculation rates and humoral immunity against PfTRAP. Our results suggest that naturally induced humoral immunity against PfTRAP contributes to the development of protection against severe malaria. Experimentally induced immunity against TRAP in different rodent models has consistently proven to elicit a high degree of protection against malaria. This together with the functional properties of TRAP and data describing CD4 and CD8 epitopes for PfTRAP indicate that this molecule could increase the protective efficiency of available sporozoite malaria vaccines.

In the present study, we used the same specimen collection from 17 villages in Coastal, Upper, and Forest Guinea to investigate the Lassa virus serology in the rodent population. The aim was to determine the dynamics of antibody development in M. natalensis and to detect potential spillover infections in other rodent species. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody screening was performed using the indirect immunofluorescence assay with the Guinean Lassa virus strain Bantou 289 as antigen. The overall seroprevalence was 8\% (129/1551) with the following rodents testing positive: 109 M. natalensis, seven Mastomys erythroleucus, four Lemniscomys striatus, four Praomys daltoni, three Mus minutoides, and two Praomys rostratus. Nearly all of them (122/129) originated from Bantou, Tanganya, and Gbetaya, where Lassa virus is highly endemic in M. natalensis. The antibody seroprevalence in M. natalensis from this high-endemic area (27\%; 108/396) depended on the village, habitat, host age, and host abundance. A main positive factor was age; the maximum seroprevalence reached 50\% in older animals. Our data fit with a model implicating that most M. natalensis rodents become horizontally infected, clear the virus within a period significantly shorter than their life span, and develop antibodies. In addition, the detection of antibodies in other species trapped in the habitats of M. natalensis suggests spillover infections.},

	abstract = {Ticks and tick-borne pathogens constitute a great threat to livestock production and are a potential health hazard to humans. Grasscutters (Thryonomys swinderianus) are widely hunted for meat in Ghana and many other West and Central African countries. However, tick-borne zoonotic risks posed by wild grasscutters have not been assessed. The objective of this study was to investigate bacterial and protozoan pathogens in ticks infecting wild grasscutters. A total of 81 ticks were collected from three hunted grasscutters purchased from Kantamanto, the central bushmeat market in Accra. Ticks were identified as Ixodes aulacodi and Rhipicephalus sp. based on morphological keys, which were further confirmed by sequencing mitochondrial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) genes of specimens. Protozoan infections were tested by PCR amplifying 18S rDNA of Babesia/Theileria/Hepatozoon, while bacterial infections were evaluated by PCRs or real-time PCRs targeting Anaplasmataceae, Borrelia, spotted fever group rickettsiae, chlamydiae and Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii. The results of PCR screening showed that 35.5\% (27 out of 76) of I. aulacodi were positive for parasite infections. Sequencing analysis of the amplified products gave one identical sequence showing similarity with Babesia spp. reported from Africa. The Ca. M. mitochondrii endosymbiont was present in 85.5\% (65 out of 76) of I. aulacodi but not in the five Rhipicephalus ticks. Two Anaplasmataceae bacteria genetically related to Ehrlichia muris and Anaplasma phagocytophilum were also detected in two I. aulacodi. None of the ticks were positive for Borrelia spp., spotted fever group rickettsiae and chlamydiae. Since I. aulacodi on wild grasscutters are potential carriers of tick-borne pathogens, some of which could be of zoonotic potential, rigorous tick control and pathogen analyses should be instituted especially when wild caught grasscutters are being used as foundation stock for breeding.},

The study was part of a broader project that was investigating Salmonella vectors in the poultry farms around the province. The study trapped 154 rodents from selected farms and used the Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and the Cytochrome b (Cyt-b) barcoding genes for species identification. Two rodent pest species, namely, Rattus rattus (the black rat) and Rattus tanezumi (the Asian Rat/Asian House Rat) were identified. A total of 99 (64.3\%) were identified as Rattus rattus and 55 (35.7\%) were Rattus tanezumi. Between the two target genes, Cyt-b gene was only able to identify 40 (25.97\%) of the total samples while COI was more efficient and amplified all the samples and thus was a better target gene for this kind of identification. The two rat species identified are known vectors of serious diseases; thus their presence should be regarded as an indication of high risk for diseases. Despite having been detected in the country before, finding R. tanezumi as the second largest rat species in the area was unexpected since this species is known to be indigenous to Asia.},

Recently, we described hedgehog Leishmania (L.) major and L. infantum infection in an L. infantum endemic area in the North-West. In order to assess if the observation could extend to other endemic areas and to highlight the potential role of hedgehogs as reservoir host, we aimed here at investigating their Leishmania infection in different foci in Tunisia located along a North-South transect, during and outside different transmission seasons. Based on morphological criteria, 2 hedgehogs' species, Atelerix algirus and Paraechinus aethiopicus were identified. Cytologic analysis showed presence of amastigotes in 9/22 samples corresponding to 4 Atelerix algirus specimens. Also, by combining 3 PCR tests targeting repeated DNA fragments using 13A/13B, Lei70R/Lei70L and nested T2/B4-L1/L4 specific primers, all hedgehogs (N = 12) showed a Leishmania infection. The infection rates were very high on spleen (91.66\%), kidney (91.66\%), blood (90.90\%), liver (83.33\%) and eye swabs (100\%). Parasites were also detected in peritoneum. Three hedgehogs were found infected with L. infantum and the only Paraechinus aethiopicus specimen with L. major. A mixed L. major and L. infantum infection was identified in 8 animals, while the last one also had an L. tropica infection. Interestingly, 2 animals had skin lesions infected with L. major while all others appeared asymptomatic. There was a correlation between infected status and epidemiological profiles of the localities. Sequences and phylogeny indicated micro-heterogeneity and lack of correlation with sampling, season, or localities. We confirmed natural infection of Atelerix algirus and originally of Paraechinus aethiopicus in Tunisia. High rate of asymptomatic infection, parasitemia, proximity to transmission cycles, epidemiological patterns of infection together with hedgehogs' abundance, lifespan and lifestyle corroborate the hypothesis they constitute reservoir hosts.},

AchPV1 and AchPV2 are classified in the family Paramyxoviridae and cluster with other bat derived zoonotic rubulaviruses (i.e. Sosuga, Menangle and Tioman viruses). To assess the susceptibility of AchPV1 and AchPV2 in animals, infection studies were conducted in ferrets, guinea pigs and mice. Seroconversion, immunohistological evidence of infection, and viral shedding were identified in ferrets and guinea pigs, but not in mice. Infection was associated with respiratory disease in ferrets. Viral genome was detected in a range of tissues from ferrets and guinea pigs, however virus isolation was only achieved from ferret tissues. The results from this study indicate Achimota viruses (AchPVs) are able to cross the species barrier. Consequently, vigilance for infection with and disease caused by these viruses in people and domesticated animals is warranted in sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula where the reservoir hosts are present.},

	abstract = {The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis (ICHH) proposes that testosterone has both beneficial effects on male reproductive potential and negative effects by suppressing the immune system. However, support for the ICHH has been variable and an alternative hypothesis suggests that testosterone may be acting indirectly via cortisol to suppress immunity (the stress-linked ICHH). A third hypothesis is that increased energetic investment in immunity results in the suppression of testosterone. We tested these hypotheses in male Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) through two separate manipulations: first, by triggering a strong immune response using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection and, secondly, by increasing circulating testosterone using silastic testosterone implants. Responding to an immune challenge significantly reduced testosterone, supporting the immune suppression hypothesis, while increasing circulating testosterone had no effect on immunocompetence, body mass, ectoparasite abundances or cortisol levels, failing to support either the ICHH or stress-linked ICHH. Our results add to the increasing body of literature that challenges the ICHH, and we conclude that the trade-off between testosterone and immunity is mediated through immune activation and not through testosterone in male Cape ground squirrels. Being able to test the ICHH, stress-linked ICHH and immune suppression hypotheses in a free-ranging mammal gives us a unique opportunity to examine the mechanisms mediating this trade-off.},

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is present from the North to the South under different forms, due to Leishmania (L.) major, L. infantum or L. tropica. Whereas, Psammomys (P.) obesus is the confirmed reservoir host of L. major, those of L. tropica and dermotropic L. infantum wait to be identified. Importantly, P. vexillaris species have been recently highlighted; however, no studies have been carried out to explore its potential role in leishmaniasis epidemiology. Seventy two rodents were collected from Central and South-West of Tunisia between 2007 and 2010. Using several methods, 43 animals were identified as P. obesus and 29 as P. vexillaris. Leishmania kinetoplast DNA was detected in liver samples by real-time PCR in 18 P. obesus and in 8 P. vexillaris. Then, the direct sequencing of the amplified internal transcribed spacer 1, allowed the identification of L. infantum DNA in five P. obesus and in three P. vexillaris, as well as L. tropica DNA in three other P. vexillaris. Whereas, PCR fluorescent fragment length analysis of the 7 spliced leaders, allowed identifying L. major among infected P. obesus and P. vexillaris, and interestingly co-infection (L. major/L. infantum) among two P. obesus. We report here for the first time, the infection of P. obesus, from Central Tunisia, by L. infantum. Suggesting that P. obesus the known reservoir host of L. major, may also serve as reservoir host for L. infantum and thus play a role in the spread of sporadic cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis in this region. Of equal importance, this work establish for the first time, the natural infection of P. vexillaris by different Leishmania species, suggesting its potential epidemiological role as reservoir host.},

However, what determines the successful establishment and spread of introduced populations remains unclear. Here, we explore several hypotheses linking invasion success and immune phenotype traits, including those based on the evolution of increased competitive ability concept. We compared gene expression profiles between anciently and recently established populations of two major invading species, the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus and the black rat Rattus rattus, in Senegal (West Africa). Transcriptome analyses identified differential expression between anciently and recently established populations for 364 mouse genes and 83 rat genes. All immune-related genes displaying differential expression along the mouse invasion route were overexpressed at three of the four recently invaded sites studied. Complement activation pathway genes were overrepresented among these genes. By contrast, no particular immunological process was found to be overrepresented among the differentially expressed genes of black rat. Changes in transcriptome profiles were thus observed along invasion routes, but with different specific patterns between the two invasive species. These changes may be driven by increases in infection risks at sites recently invaded by the house mouse, and by stochastic events associated with colonization history for the black rat. These results constitute a first step toward the identification of immune eco-evolutionary processes potentially involved in the invasion success of these two rodent species.},

The samples were processed for ultrastructural analysis and examined under the transmission electron microscope., Results: The testes of the cane rat showed uniqueness in its cellular associations and the ultrastructure of the spermatogenic cells especially in the formation of the acrosome. The spermatid differentiation and acrosomal formation occurred in 12 steps with the first three steps being the Golgi phase and the next three steps making up the cap phase. While the three steps that follow constitute the acrosomal phase, the last 3 steps make up the maturation phase. At the cap and acrosomal phases, the entire acrosomal system comprising the vesicle and granule covers the head of the spermatids with no clear indentation of the nuclear surface by the formed acrosome. Furthermore, elongated spermatids at the maturation phase contained abundance of nuclear vacuoles., Conclusion: This work has not only provided information that will further the understanding of spermatogenesis but also aid the understanding of acrosomal reaction in the reproduction of the greater cane rat.},

LASV is the causative agent of Lassa fever, a deadly hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa, whereas MOPV is non-pathogenic in humans. The Z matrix protein of arenaviruses is essential to virus assembly and budding by recruiting host factors, a mechanism that remains partially defined. To better characterize the interactions involved, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the Z proteins from LASV and MOPV as a bait. The cellular proteins ITCH and WWP1, two members of the Nedd4 family of HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, were found to bind the Z proteins of LASV, MOPV and other arenaviruses. The PPxY late-domain motif of the Z proteins is required for the interaction with ITCH, although the E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity of ITCH is not involved in Z ubiquitination. The silencing of ITCH was shown to affect the replication of the old-world mammarenaviruses LASV, MOPV, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and to a lesser extent Lujo virus (LUJV). More precisely, ITCH was involved in the egress of virus-like particles and the release of infectious progeny viruses. Thus, ITCH constitutes a novel interactor of LASV and MOPV Z proteins that is involved in virus assembly and release.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever is an acute viral illness caused by Lassa virus (LASV), a rodent-borne pathogen. LASV is endemic to much of Sub-Saharan West Africa, where seasonal outbreaks cause significant morbidity and mortality. Increased global awareness of LASV has led to development of improved diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines. As vaccine candidates are trialled, it is essential to assess the potential outcomes of introducing a LASV vaccination program in endemic regions. This study investigates the potential outcomes of routine and pulse vaccination strategies using a deterministic mathematical model that captures seasonal LASV transmission between rodents and humans. For plausible parameter values, we find that immunization of 40\% of infants at 70\% vaccine effectiveness achieves a population-level reduction in infectious case numbers of 30\%, while coverage of 60\% at 90\% vaccine effectiveness achieves a 56\% reduction. Similar reductions can be achieved more rapidly via population-wide pulse vaccination at 11\% coverage (30\% reduction at 70\% effectiveness) or 23\% coverage (56\% reduction at 90\% effectiveness) repeated every 10years. Similar pulse vaccine doses delivered at reduced frequency, but increased coverage achieves a greater reduction in infectious cases. Findings around infant vaccination are sensitive to our assumption that immunity is life-long, while pulse-vaccination has only slightly reduced effect if immunity lasts 10-30years. An effective LASV vaccination program would incorporate pulse vaccination in addition to routine childhood immunization to limit disease. Estimates of feasible vaccine coverage and effectiveness are needed to fully quantify the likely benefits of a vaccination program in LASV endemic regions. Crown Copyright © 2019.

Recent steady increase in reported cases of the disease in Nigeria, where 123 deaths occurred in 546 confirmed cases in 2019 has further underlined the need to accelerate the development of vaccines for preventing the disease. Intensified research and development of Lassa fever medical countermeasures have yielded some vaccine candidates with preclinical scientific plausibility using predominantly novel technology. The more advanced candidates are based on recombinant measles, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus or Mopiea and Lassa virus reassortants expressing Lassa virus antigens, and the deoxyribonucleic acid platform. However, the Lassa fever portfolio still lags behind other neglected tropical diseases', and further investments are needed for continued development and additional research, such as the safety and efficacy of these vaccine candidates in special populations.

We surveyed wild small mammal populations in the areas of Richard Toll and Lake Guiers, Senegal, with the objective to evaluate their potential role as intermediate hosts of larval taeniid stages (i.e. metacestodes). Based on genetic sequences of a segment of the mitochondrial DNA gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI), we identified Hydatigera parva metacestodes in 19 out of 172 (11.0\%) Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) and one out of six (16.7\%) gerbils (Taterillus sp.) and Hydatigera taeniaeformis sensu stricto metacestodes in one out of 215 (0.5\%) Nile rats (Arvicanthis niloticus). This study reports epidemiological and molecular information on H. parva and H. taeniaeformis in West African rodents, further supporting the phylogeographic hypothesis on the African origin of H. parva. Our findings may indicate significant trophic interactions contributing to the local transmission of Hydatigera spp. and other parasites with similar life-cycle mechanisms. We therefore propose that further field investigations of rodent population dynamics and rodent-borne infectious organisms are necessary to improve our understanding of host-parasite associations driving the transmission risks of rodent parasites in West Africa.},

	abstract = {Commensal rodent species are key reservoirs for Toxoplasma gondii in the domestic environment. In rodents, different T. gondii strains show variable patterns of virulence according to host species. Toxoplasma gondii strains causing non-lethal chronic infections in local hosts will be more likely to persist in a given environment, but few studies have addressed the possible role of these interactions in shaping the T. gondii population structure. In addition, the absence of validated techniques for upstream detection of T. gondii chronic infection in wild rodents hinders exploration of this issue under natural conditions. In this study, we took advantage of an extensive survey of commensal small mammals in three coastal localities of Senegal, with a species assemblage constituted of both native African species and invasive species. We tested 828 individuals for T. gondii chronic infection using the modified agglutination test for antibody detection in serum samples and a quantitative PCR assay for detection of T. gondii DNA in brain samples. The infecting T. gondii strains were genotyped whenever possible by the analysis of 15 microsatellite markers. We found (i) a very poor concordance between molecular detection and serology in the invasive house mouse, (ii) significantly different levels of prevalence by species and (iii) the autochthonous T. gondii Africa 1 lineage strains, which are lethal for laboratory mice, only in the native African species of commensal small mammals. Overall, this study highlights the need to reconsider the use of MAT serology in natural populations of house mice and provides the first known data about T. gondii genetic diversity in invasive and native species of small mammals from Africa. In light of these results, we discuss the role of invasive and native species, with their variable adaptations to different T. gondii strains, in shaping the spatial structure of T. gondii genetic diversity in Africa.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis and food-borne trematodiases are not only of major public health concern, but can also have profound implications for livestock production and wildlife conservation. The zoonotic, multi-host nature of many digenean trematodes is a significant challenge for disease control programmes in endemic areas. However, our understanding of the epidemiological role that animal reservoirs, particularly wild hosts, may play in the transmission of zoonotic trematodiases suffers a dearth of information, with few, if any, standardised, reliable diagnostic tests available. We combined qualitative and quantitative data derived from post-mortem examinations, coprological analyses using the Mini-FLOTAC technique, and molecular tools to assess parasite community composition and the validity of non-invasive methods to detect trematode infections in 89 wild Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) from northern Senegal., RESULTS: Parasites isolated at post-mortem examination were identified as Plagiorchis sp., Anchitrema sp., Echinostoma caproni, Schistosoma mansoni, and a hybrid between Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma bovis. The reports of E. caproni and Anchitrema sp. represent the first molecularly confirmed identifications for these trematodes in definitive hosts of sub-Saharan Africa. Comparison of prevalence estimates derived from parasitological analysis at post-mortem examination and Mini-FLOTAC analysis showed non-significant differences indicating comparable results between the two techniques (P = 1.00 for S. mansoni; P = 0.85 for E. caproni; P = 0.83 for Plagiorchis sp.). A Bayesian model, applied to estimate the sensitivities of the two tests for the diagnosis of Schistosoma infections, indicated similar median posterior probabilities of 83.1\% for Mini-FLOTAC technique and 82.9\% for post-mortem examination (95\% Bayesian credible intervals of 64.0-94.6\% and 63.7-94.7\%, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the Mini-FLOTAC could be applied as an alternative diagnostic technique for the detection of the zoonotic S. mansoni and other trematodes in rodent reservoirs. The implementation of non-invasive diagnostics in wildlife would offer numerous advantages over lethal sampling methodologies, with potential impact on control strategies of zoonotic helminthiases in endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa and on fostering a framework of animal use reduction in scientific practice.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever is a unique viral hemorrhagic fever that is endemic in parts of West Africa, primarily Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria. The disease is caused by the Lassa virus, an Old World arenavirus that has as primary reservoir host the multimammate rodent Mastomys nataliensis, which lives in association with humans. Recent estimates suggest LF causes two million cases and 5000-10000 deaths annually, mainly in West Africa. Clinical diagnosis and laboratory confirmation have always been major challenges for effective management and control of the disease in afflicted areas of West Africa. Recent advancements in molecular biology, recombinant DNA technology, and genomics sequencing has facilitated major advancement in development of better diagnostic and surveillance tools for Lassa fever virus. These include, the multiplex, magnetic bead-based immunodiagnostics for both Lassa virus antigens and antibodies; molecular probe-based quantitative real-time PCR for genomic signatures; rapid diagnostics tests that detects the most prevalent West African lineages; and the successful utilization of next-generation sequencing technology to diagnose and characterize Lassa virus in West Africa. These advances will continue to improve disease treatment, control, and prevention. In this review we will discuss progression of Lassa virus diagnostics from the past and into the future.

To elucidate the seasonal drivers of LF epidemics, we employed a mathematical model to analyse the datasets of human infection, rodent population dynamics and climatological variations and capture the underlying transmission dynamics. The surveillance-based incidence data of human cases in Nigeria were explored, and moreover, a mathematical model was used for describing the transmission dynamics of LF in rodent populations. While quantifying the case fatality risk and the rate of exposure of humans to animals, we explicitly estimated the corresponding contact rate of humans with infected rodents, accounting for the seasonal population dynamics of rodents. Our findings reveal that seasonal migratory dynamics of rodents play a key role in regulating the cyclical pattern of LF epidemics. The estimated timing of high exposure of humans to animals coincides with the time shortly after the start of the dry season and can be associated with the breeding season of rodents in Nigeria.

	abstract = {The Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) is the reservoir host of Lassa virus, an arenavirus that causes Lassa haemorrhagic fever in humans in West Africa. Because no vaccine exists and therapeutic options are limited, preventing infection through rodent control and human behavioural measures is currently considered to be the only option. In order to assess the efficacy of rodent control, we performed a 4-year field experiment in rural Upper Guinea and developed a mathematical model to simulate different control strategies (annual density control, continuous density control, and rodent vaccination). For the field study, rodenticide baits were placed each year in three rural villages, while three other villages were used as controls. Rodents were trapped before and after every treatment and their antibody status and age were determined. Data from the field study were used to parameterize the mathematical model. In the field study, we found a significant negative effect of rodent control on seroprevalence, but this effect was small especially given the effort. Furthermore, the rodent populations recovered rapidly after rodenticide application, leading us to conclude that an annual control strategy is unlikely to significantly reduce Lassa virus spillover to humans. In agreement with this finding, the mathematical model suggests that the use of continuous control or rodent vaccination is the only strategy that could lead to Lassa virus elimination. These field and model results can serve as a guide for determining how long and frequent rodent control should be done in order to eliminate Lassa virus in rural villages.},

	abstract = {Lassa fever virus (LASV) causes acute viral haemorrhagic fever with symptoms similar to those seen with Ebola virus infections. LASV is endemic to West Africa and is transmitted through contact with excretions of infected Mastomys natalensis rodents and other rodent species. Due to a high fatality rate, lack of treatment options and difficulties with prevention and control, LASV is one of the high-priority pathogens included in the WHO R\&D Blueprint. The WHO LASV vaccine strategy relies on availability of effective diagnostic tests. Current diagnostics for LASV include in-house and commercial (primarily research-only) laboratory-based serological and nucleic acid amplification tests. There are two commercially available (for research use only) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and a number of multiplex panels for differential detection of LASV infection from other endemic diseases with similar symptoms have been evaluated. However, a number of diagnostic gaps remain. Lineage detection is a challenge due to the genomic diversity of LASV, as pan-lineage sensitivity for both molecular and immunological detection is necessary for surveillance and outbreak response. While pan-lineage ELISA and RDTs are commercially available (for research use only), validation and external quality assessment (EQA) is needed to confirm detection sensitivity for all known or relevant strains. Variable sensitivity of LASV PCR tests also highlights the need for improved validation and EQA. Given that LASV outbreaks typically occur in low-resource settings, more options for point-of-care testing would be valuable. These requirements should be taken into account in target product profiles for improved LASV diagnostics.},

Although rodent surveys could help to assess the circulation of T. gondii, they have seldom been set up in sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of this study was to examine Toxoplasma seroprevalence in rodents from villages and towns across Senegal. Rodents were sampled in 40 localities using a standardised trapping protocol. Detection of T. gondii antibodies was performed on 1205 rodents, using a modified agglutination test (MAT) technique. Seroprevalence data were analysed depending on geography, the local rodent community, and individual characteristics of the rodent hosts. We found 44 seropositive rodents from four different species (Mastomys erythroleucus, Mastomys natalensis, Mus musculus domesticus, Rattus rattus). Toxoplasma seroprevalence was low, averaging 4\% in the localities. Higher Toxoplasma seroprevalence (up to 24\%) was found in northern Senegal, a region known to be the heart of pastoral herding in the country. Copyright © C.

We characterized the evolutionary relationships among multiple Schistosoma mansoni isolates collected from snails (intermediate hosts), humans (definitive hosts), and rodents (definitive hosts) in Senegal. On a local scale, diagnosis of S. mansoni infection ranged 3.8\%-44.8\% in school-aged children, 1.7\%-52.6\% in Mastomys huberti mice, and 1.8\%-7.1\% in Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails. Our phylogenetic framework confirmed the presence of multiple S. mansoni lineages that could infect both humans and rodents; divergence times of these lineages varied (0.13-0.02 million years ago). We propose that extensive movement of persons across West Africa might have contributed to the establishment of these various multihost S. mansoni clades. High S. mansoni prevalence in rodents at transmission sites frequented by humans further highlights the implications that alternative hosts could have on future public health interventions.},

In doing so, we document extant species distributions, which highlight the risks of continuing the range expansion of three synanthropic invasive rodent species, namely black rats (Rattus rattus), brown rats (R. norvegicus), and house mice (Mus musculus). Using various diversity estimates and community ecology approaches, we detect a latitudinal gradient of species richness that significantly decreased Northward. We show that shrews (Crocidura) represent a very important component of micro-mammal fauna in West African towns and villages, especially at lower latitudes. We also demonstrate that invasive and native synanthropic rodents do not distribute randomly in West Africa, which suggests that invasive species dynamics and history differ markedly, and that they involve gradual, as well as human-mediated, long distance dispersal. Patterns of segregation are also observed between native Mastomys natalensis and invasive rats R. rattus and R. norvegicus, suggesting potential native-to-invasive species turn over. Consequences of such processes, especially in terms of public health, are discussed.},

This study explored farmer perspectives of these species, and specifically the factors that influence these perspectives. Forty-four farmers responded to a questionnaire that assessed their ecological knowledge of, tolerance towards and lethal management of burrowing mammals that occur on their farms. The results from generalised linear models showed that neither farmer age, nor level of education are accurate predictors of ecological knowledge, overall tolerance towards burrowers, or their lethal management. Knowledge of burrowing mammals showed a significant relationship with tolerance, with more knowledgeable individuals displaying higher levels of tolerance. However, a farmer's overall tolerance towards burrowing species did not affect the number of species managed. Our results also suggest that different values are attached to different species when it comes to lethal management. Thus, farmers commonly controlled the numbers of the problem rodent species, Highveld gerbil (Gerbilliscus brantsii) and Cape ground squirrel (Xerus inauris), but were less likely to manage black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) and warthog (Phacochoerus africanus), even when experiencing these as problematic. We suggest that the larger, more charismatic species possibly evoke more sympathy from farmers. Agro-ecosystems are likely to become increasingly important for conservation in the future, and we encourage continued studies on the environmental attitudes and approaches of agricultural practitioners as a means to understanding the current status and future trends in ecologically sustainable agriculture.},

Despite this importance, information about their taxonomy and distribution is unsatisfactory, especially in eastern Africa. In this study, we collected the most comprehensive multilocus DNA dataset to date across the geographic and taxonomic range of the genus (229 genotyped specimens from 130 localities in 16 countries belonging to all currently recognized species). We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships, mapped the distribution of major genetic clades, and used the combination of cytogenetic, nuclear, and mitochondrial markers for species delimitations and taxonomic suggestions. The genus is composed of two major evolutionary groups, called here the ANSORGEI and NILOTICUS groups. The former contains four presumed species, while the latter is more diverse and we recognized nine species. Most relationships among species are not resolved, which suggests a rapid radiation (dated to early-middle Pleistocene). Further, there is an indication of reticulate evolution in Ethiopia, that is, the region of the highest Arvicanthis diversity. The distribution of genetic diversity suggests diversification in eastern Africa, followed by repeated dispersals to the west (Sudano-Guinean savannas) and to the south (Masai steppe). We propose nomenclatural changes for Ethiopian taxa and provide suggestions for future steps toward solving remaining taxonomic questions in the genus.},

The virus primarily circulates in the Mastomys natalensis reservoir and is transmitted to humans through contact with infectious rodents or their secretions; human-to-human transmission is documented as well. With the exception of Dengue fever, LASV has the highest human impact of any haemorrhagic fever virus. On-going outbreaks in Nigeria have resulted in unprecedented mortality. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed LASV as a high priority pathogen for the development of treatments and prophylactics. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines to protect against LASV infection. Although numerous candidates have demonstrated efficacy in animal models, to date, only a single candidate has advanced to clinical trials. Lassa fever vaccine development efforts have been hindered by the high cost of biocontainment requirements, the absence of established correlates of protection, and uncertainty regarding the extent to which animal models are predictive of vaccine efficacy in humans.

By day 9 p.i., lesions became visible on the skin and in some cases in the spleen. After day 9 p.i., luminescent signal representing MPXV replication either increased, indicating a progression to what would be a fatal infection, or decreased as infection was resolved. Use of recombinant luc+ MPXV allowed for a greater understanding of how MPXV disseminates throughout the body in prairie dogs during the course of infection. This technology will be used to reduce the number of animals required in future pathogenesis studies as well as aid in determining the effectiveness of potential medical countermeasures.},

	abstract = {This brief review is focused on the events surrounding the initial discovery of a new viral hemorrhagic fever in 1969 and the subsequent 10-15 years during which a substantial understanding of the disease was gained. In 1969, a series of sequential life-threating or fatal infections occurred among health care workers in Nigeria and the laboratory scientist who isolated and characterized the causative agent. The agent, Lassa virus was named after the geographical location of the first recognized human case. The new virus was shown to be related to lymphocytic choriomeningitis and to previously unclassified neotropical viruses, including Argentine and Bolivian hemorrhagic fevers, and a new taxonomic grouping, the Arenaviruses, was proposed. In 1970-72, three further epidemics occurred in Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the first two involved nosocomial transmission, and the third was a community-based outbreak, during which the rodent reservoir host was identified. In 1976, a long-term research project commenced in Sierra Leone, which produced a rich body of data from prospectively designed studies on the clinical features, transmission, and treatment of the disease.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan with a worldwide occurrence, but the determinants of the current pattern in the geographical distribution of T. gondii lineages and strains remain poorly understood. To test the influence of human trade on T. gondii populations, we conducted a population genetic study of 72 T. gondii animal isolates from Senegal, a West African country in which the ongoing inland progress of invasive murine hosts (introduced in port cities of Senegal since the 16(th) century by European sailors) is well described. Isolates were mainly collected on free-range poultry, which are considered as relevant bioindicators of T. gondii strain diversity in the domestic environment. Sampling was conducted in two port cities of Senegal (Dakar and Saint-Louis) and in one inland region (Kedougou). Population genetic analyses using 15 microsatellite markers revealed different patterns between port cities where lineages non-virulent for mice (type II, type III, and Africa 4) were predominant, and Kedougou where the mouse-virulent Africa 1 lineage was the most common. By considering the current spatial pattern in the inland progress of invasive rodents in Senegal, our results suggest that the invasive house mouse Mus musculus domesticus counter-selects the Africa 1 lineage in the invaded areas. The comparison of the microsatellite alleles of type II strains from Senegal to type II strains from other areas in Africa and Western Europe, using discriminant analysis of principal components and Network analysis, point to a mainly Western European origin of the type II lineage in Senegal. Collectively, these findings suggest that human-mediated intercontinental migrations of murine hosts are important vectors of T. gondii strains. Differential susceptibility of endemic and introduced murine hosts to various T. gondii strains probably determines the persistence of these strains in the environment, and therefore their availability for human and animal infection. Author summary Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan with a worldwide distribution and which can infects virtually all warm-blooded species, including human. Clinical expression of human toxoplasmosis, as well as T. gondii strains diversity, exhibit contrasting patterns across geographic regions. The determinants of this geographical structure are poorly understood, but a growing body of evidence supports an important role of human-mediated migrations of T. gondii hosts in the intercontinental dissemination of some parasite lineages. The results of our study conducted in Senegal suggest that the invasive house mouse-which was introduced in the port cities of this country through maritime trade since colonial times-has a dramatic influence on the T. gondii populations of invaded areas. This important T. gondii reservoir seems to be a vector for the intercontinental migrations of T. gondii. In addition, it may have a role in the selection (or the counter-selection) of local T. gondii populations found in invaded areas. This study provides insights into the mechanisms shaping T. gondii populations, thereby determining which strains will be available for human and animal infection.},

Wild and laboratory rat-induced Seoul infections have, however, been described since the early eighties, due to the omnipresence of the rodent reservoir, the brown rat Rattus norvegicus. Recent studies showed no fundamental differences between the pathogenicity and phylogeny of pet rat-induced Seoul orthohantaviruses and their formerly described wild or laboratory rat counterparts. The paucity of diagnosed Seoul virus-induced disease in the West is in striking contrast to the thousands of cases recorded since the 1980s in the Far East, particularly in China. This review of four continents (Asia, Europe, America, and Africa) puts this "emerging infection" into a historical perspective, concluding there is an urgent need for greater medical awareness of Seoul virus-induced human pathology in many parts of the world. Given the mostly milder and atypical clinical presentation, sometimes even with preserved normal kidney function, the importance of simple but repeated urine examination is stressed, since initial but transient proteinuria and microhematuria are rarely lacking.},

We carried out enquiries in a total of 144 rural households in 20 localities during July-December 2012. Bushmeat, the majority of which comprised rodents and bovids, accounted for 13\% of the animal protein consumed in these households. This consumption was significantly higher in households in which poverty was more acute (low annual income and more dependent children). We found that repeated awareness campaigns involving theatre performances and/or film screenings (multimedia campaigns) contributed to a decrease in bushmeat consumption. This decrease exceeded 62\% after exposure to four multimedia campaigns. We highlight the importance of awareness campaigns for reducing consumption of wild animals, and demonstrate the importance of recurring multimedia campaigns to maximize the impact of such conservation activities in rural communities.},

The occurrence and zoonotic potential of Plagiorchis spp. have been characterised across several countries in Asia; in contrast, information on Plagiorchis parasites in Africa remains anecdotal. We isolated a previously undescribed Plagiorchis species from the biliary tract and small intestine of 201 out of 427 small mammals collected in the region of Lake Guiers, Senegal, with local prevalence ranging from 38.6\% to 77.0\%. Conversely, Plagiorchis isolates were not observed in the 244 small mammals sampled in and around the town of Richard Toll, Senegal. Molecular phylogenetics of the internal transcribed spacer region, nuclear ribosomal DNA, and of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene, mitochondrial DNA, supported the monophyly and multi-host spectrum of this newly discovered West African Plagiorchis species. Sequencing of individual cercariae shed by Radix natalensis (Gastropoda: Lymnaeidae) suggested that these freshwater snails may act as suitable first intermediate hosts. Phylogenetic analysis yielded a highly resolved topology indicating two different clades, one composed by Plagiorchis spp. infecting rodents, insectivores, and birds, while the other included parasites of bats. Our findings showed the low host specificity and high prevalence of the isolated Plagiorchis sp. in the Lake Guiers region, with Hubert's multimammate mice (Mastomys huberti) appearing to play a primary role in the epidemiology of this parasite. The results raise concern about the zoonotic potential of Plagiorchis sp. in local communities of the Lake Guiers region, and highlight food-borne trematodiases and their link to land-use change as a neglected public health issue in regions of West Africa.},

Since its discovery in 1959, the virus has been isolated from birds, arthropods and humans in Europe and Africa. An increasing number of Usutu virus infections in humans with neurological presentations have been reported. Recently, the virus has been detected in bats and horses, which deviates from the currently proposed enzootic cycle of USUV involving several different avian and mosquito species. Despite this increasing number of viral detections in different mammalian hosts, the existence of a non-avian reservoir remains unresolved. In Kedougou, a tropical region in the southeast corner of Senegal, Usutu virus was detected, isolated and sequenced from five asymptomatic small mammals: Two different rodent species and a single species of shrew. Additional molecular characterization and in vivo growth dynamics showed that these rodents/shrew-derived viruses are closely related to the reference strain (accession number: AF013412) and are as pathogenic as other characterized strains associated with neurological invasions in human. This is the first evidence of Usutu virus isolation from rodents or shrews. Our findings emphasize the need to consider a closer monitoring of terrestrial small mammals in future active surveillance, public health, and epidemiological efforts in response to USUV in both Africa and Europe.},

These forests have alternatively been viewed as centres of diversification ("cradles") or more recently, as the opposite ("museums"). Here, we use a comparative dataset of avian and mammalian species to examine genetic diversification patterns across these forests and use these results to explain observed patterns in light of Plio-Pleistocene climatic change and life-history. Location Africa. Methods We analysed patterns of diversification across the GCF using a dataset composed of 629 and 1,048 mitochondrial sequences from 60 avian and 36 mammalian species, respectively. Uncorrected pairwise genetic distances were compared at three distinct geographical levels: west versus east of the Dahomey Gap, among the three major forest blocks, and among seven historical refugial areas. The timing of diversification was assessed for passerines, Rodentia, and Chiroptera. Results We found substantial signatures of diversification in all three levels of our geographical comparisons. We recovered substantial disparity in the amount and depth of structure of diversification patterns between low dispersers (understorey birds and rodents) and more capable dispersers (other bird species and bats). Additionally, our chronogram recovered recent speciation and intraspecific diversification across songbird and mammalian lineages. Main conclusions The discrete, and often deep, structuring of genetic diversification for both birds and mammals across the GCF revealed strong correlations between historic landscape fragmentation and dispersal ability. Our results revealed a striking amount of unrecognized genetic diversity, which may be suggestive of cryptic species. Given the rate at which these forests are being negatively impacted by human intervention, our general lack of knowledge concerning vertebrate diversity across these forests may very well impact our ability to identify evolutionary processes underlying diversity and enact meaningful conservation efforts in the future.},

The genetic diversity of LASV is the greatest challenge for vaccine development. The reassortant ML29 carrying the L segment from the nonpathogenic Mopeia virus (MOPV) and the S segment from LASV is a vaccine candidate under current development. ML29 demonstrated complete protection in validated animal models against a Nigerian strain from clade II, which was responsible for the worst outbreak on record in 2018. This study demonstrated that ML29 was more attenuated than MOPV in STAT1(-/-) mice, a small animal model of human LF and its sequelae. ML29 infection of these mice resulted in more than a thousand-fold reduction in viremia and viral load in tissues and strong LASV-specific adaptive T cell responses compared to MOPV-infected mice. Persistent infection of Vero cells with ML29 resulted in generation of interfering particles (IPs), which strongly interfered with the replication of LASV, MOPV and LCMV, the prototype of the Arenaviridae. ML29 IPs induced potent cell-mediated immunity and were fully attenuated in STAT1(-/-) mice. Formulation of ML29 with IPs will improve the breadth of the host's immune responses and further contribute to development of a pan-LASV vaccine with full coverage meeting the WHO requirements.},

Recently, different rodent species carrying diverse lineages of the Lassa virus (LASV) in addition to a novel Mobala-like genetic sequence were detected within the country. Here, screening 906 small mammal specimens from 11 localities for IgG antibodies and incorporating previous PCR detection data involving the same populations, we further describe arenavirus prevalence across Nigeria in relation to host species and geographical location. Methods: Small mammals were trapped during the period 2011-2015 according to geographical location (endemic and non endemic zones for Lassa fever), season (rainy and dry seasons between 2011 and 2012 for certain localities) and habitat (indoois, peridomestic settings and sylvatic vegetation). identification of animal specimens from genera such as Mastomys and Mus (Nannomys) was assisted by DNA sequencing. Small mammals were tested for LASV IgG antibody using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Results: Small mammals were infected in both the endemic and non-endemic zones for Lassa fever, with a wider range of species IgG-positive (n = 8) than those which had been previously detected to be PCR-positive (n = 3). IgG-positive species, according to number of infected individuals, were Mastomys natalensis (n = 40), Mastomys erythroleucus (n = 15), Praomys daltoni (n = 6), Mus baoulei (n = 5), Rattus rattus (n = 2), Crocidura spp. (n = 2), Mus minutoides (n = 1) and Praomys misonnei (n = 1). Multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis and M. erythroleucus) were the most ubiquitously infected, with animals testing positive by either PCR or IgG in 7 out of the 11 localities sampled IgG prevalence in M. natalensis ranged from 1\% in Abagboro, 17-36\% in Eguare Egoro, Ekpoma and Ngel Nyaki, up to 52 \% in Mayo Ranewo. Prevalence according to locality, season and age was not, however, statistically significant for M. natalensis in Eguare Egoro and Ekpoma, localities that were sampled longitudinally. Conclusions: Overall, our study demonstrates that arenavirus occurrence is probably more widely distributed geographically and in extent of host taxa than is currently realized. This expanded scope should be taken into consideration in Lassa fever control efforts. further sampling should also be carried out to isolate and characterize potential arenaviruses present in small mammal populations we found to be seropositive.},

Rodents are prominent invasive species, and act as reservoirs in many zoonotic infectious diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the link between the distribution and spread of two parasite taxa (Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma lewisi) and the progressive invasion of Senegal by two commensal rodent species (the house mouse Mus musculus domesticus and the black rat Rattus rattus). M. m. domesticus and R. rattus have invaded the northern part and the central/ southern part of the country, respectively. Native and invasive rodents were caught in villages and cities along the invasion gradients of both invaders, from coastal localities towards the interior of the land. Molecular diagnosis of the two trypanosomatid infections was performed using spleen specimens. In the north, neither M. m. domesticus nor the native species were carriers of these parasites. Conversely, in the south, 17.5\% of R. rattus were infected by L. major and 27.8\% by T. lewisi, while very few commensal native rodents were carriers. Prevalence pattern along invasion gradients, together with the knowledge on the geographical distribution of the parasites, suggested that the presence of the two parasites in R. rattus in Senegal is of different origins. Indeed, the invader R. rattus could have been locally infected by the native parasite L. major. Conversely, it could have introduced the exotic parasite T. lewisi in Senegal, the latter appearing to be poorly transmitted to native rodents. Altogether, these data show that R. rattus is a carrier of both parasites and could be responsible for the emergence of new foci of cutaneous leishmaniasis, or for the transmission of atypical human trypanosomiasis in Senegal.},

Our study focused on the plague-endemic West Nile region of Uganda, where a majority of residents live in Uganda government-defined poverty, rely on subsistence farming for a living, and frequently experience incursions of rodents into their homes. In this study, we show that rodent removal was achieved in a median of 6 days of intensive lethal trapping with multiple trap types (range: 0-16 days). However, rodent abundance in 68.9\% of homesteads returned to pretreatment levels within a median of 8 weeks (range 1-24 weeks), and at least a single rodent was captured in all homesteads by a median of 2 weeks (range 1-16 weeks) after removal efforts were terminated. Results were similar between homesteads that practiced rodent control whether or not their neighbors implemented similar strategies. Overall, intensive lethal trapping inside homes appears to be effective at reducing rodent abundance, but control was short lived after trapping ceased.},

	abstract = {While niche separation and relationships with environmental conditions of large mammals of the African savanna have been studied intensively, less conspicuous components have not received similar attention. This is the case of Kafue National Park (KNP), Zambia, where mechanisms supporting coexistence among rodent and shrew species remain unclear, much less the influence of fire on their dietary resource use. Here, we use stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to assess dietary resource use and partitioning among rodents and shrews found in three vegetation formations of KNP. According to the nitrogen isotope signatures, rodents are one to two trophic levels above primary production, save for Mus triton that is above by two to three. Shrews are two trophic levels above primary production. Among shrews, factors allowing coexistence of similar sized species could not be resolved. Rodent species of the same assemblage either differ in body mass by a factor of two (following Hutchinson's rule) or similar sized species occupy different trophic levels or dietary guilds based on their isotopic nitrogen or carbon signatures. At sites with frequent fires, rodents have broader dietary niches than at sites with low fire frequencies. This could either indicate relaxed competition under high fire frequencies as rodent populations do not reach the carrying capacity of the habitat, or it could reflect reduced competition due to lower species numbers under high versus low fire recurrence regimes. The results indicate competition as an important component structuring rodent communities in Zambian savannas, thus suggesting limited resources.},

	abstract = {Background: In mammals and across rat species, the variation in conformation is markedly observed in the head and the variation in the shape of the head is mostly determined by the shape of the skull. Hence comparative topographic analysis and morphometry is a veritable tool in precise categorization of peri-domestic rats and species identification. Methods: Killed rodents around residential dwellings of students on campus were collected and measurements taken of external morphology. Thirty-one external head and corporal parameters; and 40 cranial measurements respectively were obtained. Topographic features and specific anatomical landmarks measured were matched using congruent anatomical landmarks and compared to referenced standard measurements. Results: External morphometry suggests that all retrieved samples were more closely related to the species Rattus rattus. However, craniodental analysis of captured rats reveals variations from the mean of typical R. rattus. In comparison with Mastomys natalensis, the mean averages of the rat species were perceptibly different for only two of the parameters viz palatine fissure length (PL) (p = 0.039) and distance between interparietal bone (DP) (p = 0.06). In contrast, the mean of whole length of skull (WL), length of diastema (PI), length of nasal bone (NL), length of frontal bone (LF) and occipital width (OH) were significantly different from that of R. rattus with p values of 0.047, 0.036, 0.048, 0.032 and 0.034 respectively. Conclusion: This study focuses on peridomestic rat's identification within the University campus based on morphometry, providing unique landmarks for differentiation between Mastomys, Mus, Rattus and other rat species with emphasis on the need for more comprehensive investigation, categorization and morphometric profiling of rat population in Nigeria. Metric data generated for rat profiling in Nigeria is pivotal for a more comprehensive strategy for prevention of Lassa fever. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Finally, we observed that protection can be achieved in mice down to 8 mg/kg/day, which is lower than the dosing regimens previously reported.

	abstract = {The last National Forest Inventory of Sierra Leone took place more than four decades ago in 1975. There appears to be no legal deﬁnition of “forest” in Sierra Leone and it is sometimes unclear whether reports are referring to the forest as a “land use” or a “land cover”. Estimates of forest loss in the Global Forest Resource Assessment Country Reports are based on the estimated rate during the period 1975 to 1986, and this has not been adjusted for the eﬀects of the civil war, economic booms and busts, and the human population doubling (from about three million in 1975 to over seven million in 2018). Country estimates as part of the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) Global Forest Assessment for 2015 aggregate several classes that are not usually considered as “forest” in normal discourse in Sierra Leone (for example, mangrove swamps, rubber plantations and Raphia palm swamps). This paper makes use of maps from 1950, 1975, and 2000/2 to discuss the fate of forests in Sierra Leone. The widely accepted narrative on forest loss in Sierra Leone and generally in West Africa is that it is rapid, drastic and recent. We suggest that the validity of this narrative depends on how you deﬁne “forest”. This paper provides a detailed description of what has happened, and at the same time, oﬀers a diﬀerent view on the relationship between forests and people than the ideas put forward by James Fairhead and Melissa LeachIf we are going to progress the debate about forests in West Africa, up-to-date information and the involvement of all stakeholders are needed to contribute to the debate on what to measure. Otherwise, the decades-old assumption that the area of forest in Sierra Leone lies between less than 5\% and more than 75\%, provides an error margin that is not useful. This, therefore, necessitates a new forest inventory.},

	abstract = {Often overshadowed by global trends in urbanization, counter-urbanization is also on the rise worldwide. Left unaddressed, counter-urbanization can result in conditions that imperil human well-being. For example, counter-urbanization is hypothesized to increase the prevalence of ecological hazards like synanthropic pest and pathogen host species by shifting habitat and resource availability. In this study, we addressed this hypothesis by examining whether the abundance or diversity of rodent hosts varies according to the prevalence of abandoned, unmaintained properties across a mosaic of counter-urbanization in post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans (Louisiana, USA). We also sought to determine whether management of vacant lots can influence the abundance or diversity of rodents across counter-urbanizing landscapes. Analysis of capture data from multi-year trapping efforts across the greater New Orleans area showed that total rodent abundance was highest in residential areas with high levels of vacancy and unmaintained vegetation as well as low household income and low residency. Greater rodent abundance and richness also occurred in areas with features related to infrastructure loss, such as trash and debris, especially in winter. While these results highlight that property abandonment can augment populations of pest and pathogen host species, our findings also indicate that management of abandoned areas can potentially mitigate public health concerns in counter-urbanizing landscapes.},

The data indicate that the rodent fauna of cocoa groves contains both savanna-derived and forest-derived elements, though some habitat specialist species were absent. Habitats with a high percentage of understory cover showed a higher rodent species diversity and biomass than those with a sparse understory. The habitats contained 43\% of the predicted small mammal fauna, including 33\% of the forest-dwelling species. Missing species were mostly arboreal forms.

This can lead to over-allocation of resources to diseases that are incorrectly labelled “emerging,” and insufficient allocation of resources to diseases for which evidence of an increasing or high sustained impact is strong. We suggest a simple quantitative approach, segmented regression, to characterize the trends and emergence of diseases. Segmented regression identifies one or more trends in a time series and determines the most statistically parsimonious split(s) (or joinpoints) in the time series. These joinpoints in the time series indicate time points when a change in trend occurred and may identify periods in which drivers of disease impact change. We illustrate the method by analyzing temporal patterns in incidence data for twelve diseases. This approach provides a way to classify a disease as currently emerging, re-emerging, receding, or stable based on temporal trends, as well as to pinpoint the time when the change in these trends happened. We argue that quantitative approaches to defining emergence based on the trend in impact of a disease can, with appropriate context, be used to prioritize resources for research and control. Implementing this more rigorous definition of an EID will require buy-in and enforcement from scientists, policy makers, peer reviewers and journal editors, but has the potential to improve resource allocation for global health.},

	abstract = {Statistical approaches for inferring the spatial distribution of taxa (Species Distribution Models, SDMs) commonly rely on available occurrence data, which is often clumped and geographically restricted. Although available SDM methods address some of these factors, they could be more directly and accurately modelled using a spatially-explicit approach. Software to fit models with spatial autocorrelation parameters in SDMs are now widely available, but whether such approaches for inferring SDMs aid predictions compared to other methodologies is unknown. Here, within a simulated environment using 1000 generated species’ ranges, we compared the performance of two commonly used non-spatial SDM methods (Maximum Entropy Modelling, MAXENT and boosted regression trees, BRT), to a spatial Bayesian SDM method (fitted using R-INLA), when the underlying data exhibit varying combinations of clumping and geographic restriction. Finally, we tested how any recommended methodological settings designed to account for spatially non-random patterns in the data impact inference. Spatial Bayesian SDM method was the most consistently accurate method, being in the top 2 most accurate methods in 7 out of 8 data sampling scenarios. Within high-coverage sample datasets, all methods performed fairly similarly. When sampling points were randomly spread, BRT had a 1–3\% greater accuracy over the other methods and when samples were clumped, the spatial Bayesian SDM method had a 4\%-8\% better AUC score. Alternatively, when sampling points were restricted to a small section of the true range all methods were on average 10–12\% less accurate, with greater variation among the methods. Model inference under the recommended settings to account for autocorrelation was not impacted by clumping or restriction of data, except for the complexity of the spatial regression term in the spatial Bayesian model. Methods, such as those made available by R-INLA, can be successfully used to account for spatial autocorrelation in an SDM context and, by taking account of random effects, produce outputs that can better elucidate the role of covariates in predicting species occurrence. Given that it is often unclear what the drivers are behind data clumping in an empirical occurrence dataset, or indeed how geographically restricted these data are, spatially-explicit Bayesian SDMs may be the better choice when modelling the spatial distribution of target species.},

	abstract = {Improving detection probabilities for rare species is critical when assessing presence or habitat associations. Our goal was to create a new small mammal trapping protocol that improved detection of rare species, such as the olive-backed pocket mouse (Perognathus fasciatus). We used three trap and bait types and trapped an area 4.4 times larger than the standard grid. We also assessed the effect of captures of non-target species on detection probability of pocket mice. Regardless of species, trap success was higher for Havaharts. We found that bait and trap type selection varied significantly by species, with pocket mice showing strongest selection for Havahart traps baited with bird seed. Increasing grid size, while maintaining a similar trapping effort, resulted in higher detection probability, although our analyses showed that effective grids can be about three-quarters of the size we use to achieve similar results. We were also able to demonstrate that by deploying a combination of different traps and baits it is possible to overcome the potential effect of non-target species (e.g., deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus) on the detection probability of pocket mice. Our results show that simple changes to standard small-mammal trapping methods can dramatically increase the detectability of rare and elusive small mammals. Increasing detection probability of rare components of a community can improve the results and understanding of future studies.},

Space-time clustering is modeled in seismology by self-exciting point processes and the focus of this paper is to show that these methods are well suited for criminological applications. We ﬁrst review self-exciting point processes in the context of seismology. Next, using residential burglary data provided by the Los Angeles Police Department, we illustrate the implementation of self-exciting point process models in the context of urban crime. For this purpose we use a fully non-parametric estimation methodology to gain insight into the form of the space-time triggering function and temporal trends in the background rate of burglary.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Abstract Background: It is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We aimed to i) examine the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory virus infections a year previous; ii) compare current smoking in cases with age- and sex-matched London prevalence; and iii) examine concordance between smoking status recorded on the electronic health record (EHR) and the medical notes. Methods: This retrospective case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, UK. London smoking prevalence was obtained from the representative Annual Population Survey. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another respiratory virus). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered on the Open Science Framework. Findings: Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 had lower odds of being current smokers than patients admitted with other respiratory viruses (ORadj=0.55, 95\% CI=0.31-0.96, p=.04). Odds were equivocal for former smokers (ORadj=1.08, 95\% CI=0.72-1.65, p=.70). Current smoking in cases was significantly lower than expected from London prevalence (9.4\% vs. 12.9\%, p=.02). Smoking status recorded on the EHR deviated significantly from that recorded within the medical notes (χ2(3)=226.7, p\&lt;.001). Interpretation: In a single hospital trust in the UK, patients hospitalised with COVID-19 had reduced odds of being current smokers compared with patients admitted with other respiratory viruses a year previous.

	abstract = {Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV [SARS-COV-2]) was detected in humans during the last week of December 2019 at Wuhan city in China, and caused 24 554 cases in 27 countries and territories as of 5 February 2020. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of transmission of 2019-nCoV through human passenger air flight from four major cities of China (Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou) to the passengers' destination countries. We extracted the weekly simulated passengers' end destination data for the period of 1–31 January 2020 from FLIRT, an online air travel dataset that uses information from 800 airlines to show the direct flight and passengers' end destination. We estimated a risk index of 2019-nCoV transmission based on the number of travellers to destination countries, weighted by the number of confirmed cases of the departed city reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). We ranked each country based on the risk index in four quantiles (4th quantile being the highest risk and 1st quantile being the lowest risk). During the period, 388 287 passengers were destined for 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories across the world. The risk index of 2019-nCoV among the countries had a very high correlation with the WHO-reported confirmed cases (0.97). According to our risk score classification, of the countries that reported at least one Coronavirus-infected pneumonia (COVID-19) case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4th quantile of the risk index, two in the 3rd quantile, one in the 2nd quantile and none in the 1st quantile. Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which reported at least one case. In pan-Europe, UK, France, Russia, Germany and Italy; in North America, USA and Canada; in Oceania, Australia had high risk, all of them reported at least one case. In Africa and South America, the risk of transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the countries where at least one case is detected. The risk of transmission on 31 January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and Canada). Increased public health response including early case recognition, isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening, public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of further spread to naïve countries.},

This study examined the relationship between fat mass (n=98; 75M, 23 F) and behavioural measures of eating and obesity related psychological traits (n=337; 226M, 111 F) in overweight and obese individuals (Mean BMI 30.5±4.0; BMI range 25–46kg/m2). Two sets of principal component analyses (PCA) were performed: one on validated questionnaires of eating behaviour and psychological traits and a second on fat mass and body weight related anthropometric measures (BMI, weight) and the aforementioned questionnaire measures. From the initial PCA (n=337), the primary principal component, P1 (R2 value of 0.33), represented a latent variable associated with overeating or binge eating behaviour. In a second PCA (questionnaire measures augmented by anthropometric variables, n=98), a single component was identified, P1+ (R2 of 0.28), similar to that identified as P1 in the previous analysis and this component was highly correlated with fat mass (ρ=0.68). These findings suggest that levels of body fat and eating behaviour (namely, binging or overeating) are strongly related and, at least in a subgroup of individuals, obesity may be driven by behavioural factors associated with eating in combination with pre-existing environmental and genetic factors.},

Unfortunately, the lack of quantitative linkages between environmental and human health has limited recognition of these principle. Advent of COVID-19 pandemic provides the impetus for the further discussion. We propose ecological countermeasures as highly targeted, landscape-based interventions to arrest the drivers of land use-induced zoonotic spillover. We provide examples of ecological restoration activities that reduce zoonotic disease risk and a five-point action plan at the human-ecosystem health nexus. In conclusion, we make the case that ecological countermeasures are a tenent of restoration ecology with human health goals.},

	abstract = {This paper argues for an integrative modelling approach for understanding zoonoses disease dynamics, combining process, pattern and participatory models. Each type of modelling provides important insights, but all are limited. Combining these in a ‘3P’ approach offers the opportunity for a productive conversation between modelling efforts, contributing to a ‘One Health’ agenda. The aim is not to come up with a composite model, but seek synergies between perspectives, encouraging cross-disciplinary interactions. We illustrate our argument with cases from Africa, and in particular from our work on Ebola virus and Lassa fever virus. Combining process-based compartmental models with macroecological data offers a spatial perspective on potential disease impacts. However, without insights from the ground, the ‘black box’ of transmission dynamics, so crucial to model assumptions, may not be fully understood. We show how participatory modelling and ethnographic research of Ebola and Lassa fever can reveal social roles, unsafe practices, mobility and movement and temporal changes in livelihoods. Together with longer-term dynamics of change in societies and ecologies, all can be important in explaining disease transmission, and provide important complementary insights to other modelling efforts. An integrative modelling approach therefore can offer help to improve disease control efforts and public health responses.This article is part of the themed issue ‘One Health for a changing world: zoonoses, ecosystems and human well-being’.},

Its emergence is notable due to its impacts on individuals residing within long term care facilities (LTCFs) such as rehabilitation centers and nursing homes.

We did not restrict our search to the English language. Our search retrieved two reports of original research. The relevant publications described transmission and course of infection among residents in LTCFs. Of particular relevance was that large quantities of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA could be detected in asymptomatic, presymptomatic and symptomatic residents, providing early evidence of the heterogeneity of infection characteristics among residents at LTCFs. A significant number of LTCF residents were presymptomatic with symptoms emerging 7 days after initial detection of viral RNA, indicating a longer than expected latency period. Therefore, symptomatic screening for early detection and resultant mitigation response was likely to be ineffective in preventing transmission among residents of LTCFs. There were no reports involving longitudinal surveillance testing of LTCF staff.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Added value of this study{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}While prior studies reported results of facility-wide (residents and staff) testing for SARS-CoV-2 and describe transmission dynamics among residents of LTCFs, no prior data was available describing the longitudinal characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics among staff working at LTCFs during a time period where “shelter-in-place” public guidance was in effect. During this time period, LTCF residents were largely isolated, however staff (those with both direct care and those without direct contact) were permitted to leave and return to work daily. We were therefore interested in this broad staff cohort specifically because they represent a significant and ongoing potential source of transmission within LTCFs. RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed weekly on 544 staff in six LTCFs over an 8-11-week period.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Symptom data were collected and site-specific prevalence at study onset and incidence rate over time were calculated to explore the influence of identifying and removing asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals from the workplace.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Implications of all the available evidence{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Our results document a surprising degree of asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic infection among apparently healthy staff, and extreme variation in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and incidence among staff between different facilities. Plaque assay revealed a strong relationship between vRNA and infectious virus in nasopharyngeal swab material, indicating the asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals are infectious. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected from LTCF staff suggest that the predominant transmission pattern is between staff members within facilities, and that individual unrelated community import events are less common. Finally, decreasing prevalence over time within facilities where longitudinal surveillance testing was performed suggests that identifying and isolating positive staff may serve as part of an effective mitigation program to prevent or curtail transmission among staff within LTCFs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background The use of computed tomography (CT) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis in an area of northern Italy with a high incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may have identified more patients with this disease than RT-PCR in the very early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 148 chest CT scans of oncological patients who were referred to the Radiological Unit of Policlinico S. Marco from 1 February 2020 to 30 April 2020, during the COVID-19 outbreak in Bergamo area. In parallel, we analyzed RT-PCR tests of these 148 patients. Results Among 32 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, 17 patients were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms (53.1\%), while 15 developed severe disease (46.8\%). The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 22.9\%, the mortality rate was 18.8\%. We did not find any correlation between disease severity and age, sex, smoking, or cardiovascular comorbidities. Remarkably, patients who were on treatment for cancer developed a milder disease than patients who were not on treatment. Conclusions The acceptance of CT-defined diagnoses in COVID-19 high-incidence areas like Bergamo region highlighted a larger oncological population affected by COVID-19 than RT-PCR, in particular, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients, because only symptomatic patients underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed that patients actively treated for their cancer had a milder disease, in agreement with previous studies that suggested a protective role of immunosuppression. Admittedly, the sample of patients in our study was heterogeneous regarding the oncological disease, their prognosis, and the type of treatment; therefore, other studies are needed to confirm our data.},

              Retrospective observational study using electronic medical record data.
            
            
              Setting
              Five member hospitals from the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City (NYC).
            
            
              Participants
              28 336 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 from 24 February 2020 to 15 April 2020, including 6158 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases.
            
            
              Main outcomes and measures
              Positive test rates and in-hospital mortality were assessed for different racial groups. Among positive cases admitted to the hospital (N=3273), we estimated HR for both discharge and death across various explanatory variables, including patient demographics, hospital site and unit, smoking status, vital signs, lab results and comorbidities.
            
            
              Results
              Hispanics (29\%) and African Americans (25\%) had disproportionately high positive case rates relative to their representation in the overall NYC population (p{\textless}0.05); however, no differences in mortality rates were observed in hospitalised patients based on race. Outcomes differed significantly between hospitals (Gray’s T=248.9; p{\textless}0.05), reflecting differences in average baseline age and underlying comorbidities. Significant risk factors for mortality included age (HR 1.05, 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.06; p=1.15e-32), oxygen saturation (HR 0.985, 95\% CI 0.982 to 0.988; p=1.57e-17), care in intensive care unit areas (HR 1.58, 95\% CI 1.29 to 1.92; p=7.81e-6) and elevated creatinine (HR 1.75, 95\% CI 1.47 to 2.10; p=7.48e-10), white cell count (HR 1.02, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.04; p=8.4e-3) and body mass index (BMI) (HR 1.02, 95\% CI 1.00 to 1.03; p=1.09e-2). Deceased patients were more likely to have elevated markers of inflammation.
            
            
              Conclusions
              While race was associated with higher risk of infection, we did not find racial disparities in inpatient mortality suggesting that outcomes in a single tertiary care health system are comparable across races. In addition, we identified key clinical features associated with reduced mortality and discharge. These findings could help to identify which COVID-19 patients are at greatest risk of a severe infection response and predict survival.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          SARS-CoV-2 emerged in 2019 and has become a major global pathogen in an astonishingly short period of time. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 also has been notable due to its impacts on individuals residing within skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) such as rehabilitation centers and nursing homes. SNF residents tend to possess several risk factors for the most severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including advanced age and the presence of multiple comorbidities. Indeed, residents of long-term care facilities represent approximately 40 percent of US SARS-CoV-2 deaths. To assess the prevalence and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among SNF workers, determine the extent of asymptomatic infection by SARS-CoV-2, and provide information on the genomic epidemiology of the virus within these unique care settings, we sampled workers weekly at five SNFs in Colorado using nasopharyngeal swabs, determined the presence of viral RNA and infectious virus among these workers, and sequenced 48 nearly complete genomes. This manuscript reports results from the first five to six weeks of observation. Our data reveal a strikingly high degree of asymptomatic infection, a strong correlation between RNA detection and the presence of infectious virus in NP swabs, persistent RNA in a subset of individuals, and declining incidence over time. Our data suggests that asymptomatic individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to virus transmission within the workplace.},

          ISARIC (International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium) partnerships and outbreak preparedness initiatives enabled the rapid launch of standardised clinical data collection on COVID-19 in Jan 2020. Extensive global uptake of this resource has resulted in a large, standardised collection of comprehensive clinical data from hundreds of sites across dozens of countries. Data are analysed regularly and reported publicly to inform patient care and public health response. This report is a part of a series and includes the results of data analysis on 20 November 2020.
          We thank all of the data contributors for their ongoing support.
          
            Report highlights include
            ISARIC collaborators recorded symptoms from over 122,000 patients in hospital with COVID-19. Most had fever, cough or shortness of breath. Children and older adults were less likely to display typical symptoms, and over 40\% of patients {\textgreater}80 years experienced confusion.
            The ISARIC international database continues to grow. Data have been entered for 122,361 individuals from 578 sites across 42 countries. The analysis detailed in this report only includes individuals:
            
              
                for whom data collection commenced on or before 26 October 2020.
                AND
              
              
                who have laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed SARS-COV-2 infection.
              
            
            
              For the
              95,966
              cases who meet eligibility criteria for this report:
            
            
              
                ∘
                The median age is 72 years.
              
              
                ∘
                A total of 20\% of patients were admitted at some point during their illness into an intensive care unit.
              
              
                ∘
                Antibiotic use is high (81.9\% of patients received antibiotics - the choice of antibiotic and specific indication have not yet been determined.)
              
              
                ∘
                Fever, shortness of breath, a non-productive cough and fatigue were the most common symptoms.
              
              
                ∘
                Altered consciousness/confusion was also relatively frequent (20,802/95,079) and most common in elderly patients. Overall, elderly patients are less likely to present with URTI symptoms.

	abstract = {Objective
              In earlier studies, patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD) who got infected with COVID-19 had a higher risk of mechanical ventilation than comparators. We sought to determine COVID-19 outcomes among patients with RMD 6 months into the pandemic.
            
            
              Methods
              We conducted a cohort study at Mass General Brigham in Boston, Massachusetts, of patients with RMD matched to up to five comparators by age, sex and COVID-19 diagnosis date (between 30 January 2020 and 16 July 2020) and followed until last encounter or 18 August 2020. COVID-19 outcomes were compared using Cox regression. Risk of mechanical ventilation was compared in an early versus a recent cohort of patients with RMD.
            
            
              Results
              We identified 143 patients with RMD and with COVID-19 (mean age 60 years; 76\% female individuals) and 688 comparators (mean age 59 years; 76\% female individuals). There were no significantly higher adjusted risks of hospitalisation (HR: 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.68–1.11), intensive care unit admission (HR: 1.27, 95\% CI: 0.86–1.86), or mortality (HR: 1.02, 95\% CI: 0.53–1.95) in patients with RMD versus comparators. There was a trend towards a higher risk of mechanical ventilation in the RMD cohort versus comparators, although not statistically significant (adjusted HR: 1.51, 95\% CI: 0.93–2.44). There was a trend towards improvement in mechanical ventilation risk in the recent versus early RMD cohort (10\% vs 19\%, adjusted HR: 0.44, 95\% CI: 0.17–1.12).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Patients with RMD and comparators had similar risks of poor COVID-19 outcomes after adjusting for race, smoking and comorbidities. The higher risk of mechanical ventilation in the early RMD cohort was no longer detected in a recent cohort, suggesting improved management over time.},

              Background
              COVID-19 can course with respiratory and extrapulmonary disease. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in respiratory samples but also in blood, stool and urine. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by a dysregulated host response to this virus. We studied whether viral RNAemia or viral RNA load in plasma is associated with severe COVID-19 and also to this dysregulated response.
            
            
              Methods
              A total of 250 patients with COVID-19 were recruited (50 outpatients, 100 hospitalized ward patients and 100 critically ill). Viral RNA detection and quantification in plasma was performed using droplet digital PCR, targeting the N1 and N2 regions of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein gene. The association between SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma with severity was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression. Correlations between viral RNA load and biomarkers evidencing dysregulation of host response were evaluated by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficients.
            
            
              Results
              
                The frequency of viral RNAemia was higher in the critically ill patients (78\%) compared to ward patients (27\%) and outpatients (2\%) (
                p
                 {\textless} 0.001). Critical patients had higher viral RNA loads in plasma than non-critically ill patients, with non-survivors showing the highest values. When outpatients and ward patients were compared, viral RNAemia did not show significant associations in the multivariate analysis. In contrast, when ward patients were compared with ICU patients, both viral RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma were associated with critical illness (OR [CI 95\%],
                p
                ): RNAemia (3.92 [1.183–12.968], 0.025), viral RNA load (N1) (1.962 [1.244–3.096], 0.004); viral RNA load (N2) (2.229 [1.382–3.595], 0.001). Viral RNA load in plasma correlated with higher levels of chemokines (CXCL10, CCL2), biomarkers indicative of a systemic inflammatory response (IL-6, CRP, ferritin), activation of NK cells (IL-15), endothelial dysfunction (VCAM-1, angiopoietin-2, ICAM-1), coagulation activation (D-Dimer and INR), tissue damage (LDH, GPT), neutrophil response (neutrophils counts, myeloperoxidase, GM-CSF) and immunodepression (PD-L1, IL-10, lymphopenia and monocytopenia).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia and viral RNA load in plasma are associated with critical illness in COVID-19. Viral RNA load in plasma correlates with key signatures of dysregulated host responses, suggesting a major role of uncontrolled viral replication in the pathogenesis of this disease.},

              Clinical features and natural history of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) differ widely among different countries and during different phases of the pandemia. Here, we aimed to evaluate the case fatality rate (CFR) and to identify predictors of mortality in a cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to three hospitals of Northern Italy between March 1 and April 28, 2020. All these patients had a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by molecular methods. During the study period 504/1697 patients died; thus, overall CFR was 29.7\%. We looked for predictors of mortality in a subgroup of 486 patients (239 males, 59\%; median age 71 years) for whom sufficient clinical data were available at data cut-off. Among the demographic and clinical variables considered, age, a diagnosis of cancer, obesity and current smoking independently predicted mortality. When laboratory data were added to the model in a further subgroup of patients, age, the diagnosis of cancer, and the baseline PaO

              ratio were identified as independent predictors of mortality. In conclusion, the CFR of hospitalized patients in Northern Italy during the ascending phase of the COVID-19 pandemic approached 30\%. The identification of mortality predictors might contribute to better stratification of individual patient risk.},

            Background
            Understanding community-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission is crucial to inform public health decisions. Research on SARS-CoV-2 transmission within households and other close settings using serological testing is scarce.
          
          
            Methods
            We invited COVID-19 cases diagnosed between February 27 and April 1, 2020 in canton of Vaud, Switzerland, to participate, along with household members and other close contacts. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were measured using a Luminex immunoassay. We estimated factors associated with serological status using generalized estimating equations.
          
          
            Findings
            Overall, 219 COVID-19 index cases, 302 household members, and 69 other close contacts participated between May 4 and June 27, 2020. More than half of household members (57·2\%, 95\%CI 49·7-64·3) had developed a serologic response to SARS-CoV-2, while 19·0\% (95\%CI 10·0-33·2) of other close contacts were seropositive. After adjusting for individual and household characteristics, infection risk was higher in household members aged 65 or more than in younger adults (aOR 3·63, 95\%CI 1·05-12·60), and in those not strictly adhering to simple hygiene rules like hand washing (aOR 1·80, 95\%CI 1·02-3·17). The risk was lower when more than 5 people outside home were met during the semi-confinement, compared to none (aOR 0·35, 95\%CI 0·16-0·74). The individual risk of household members to be seropositive was lower in large households (22\% less per each additional person).
          
          
            Interpretation
            We find that, during semi-confinement, household members of a COVID-19 case were at very high risk of getting infected, 3 times more than close contacts outside home. This highlights the need to provide clear messages on specific protective measures applicable at home. For elderly couples, who were especially at risk, providing them external support for daily basic activities is essential.

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, which emerged in China in late 2019, rapidly spread across the world causing several million victims in 213 countries. Switzerland was severely hit by the virus, with 43’000 confirmed cases as of September 1st, 2020.
          
          
            Aim
            In cooperation with the Federal Office of Public Health, we set up a surveillance database in February 2020 to monitor hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in addition to their mandatory reporting system.
          
          
            Methods
            Patients hospitalised for more than 24 hours with a positive PCR test, from 20 Swiss hospitals, are included. Data collection follows a custom Case Report Form based on WHO recommendations and adapted to local needs. Nosocomial infections were defined as infections for which the onset of symptoms started more than 5 days after the patient’s admission date.
          
          
            Results
            As of September 1st, 2020, 3645 patients were included. Most patients were male (2168 - 59.5\%),and aged between 50 and 89 years (2778 - 76.2\%), with a median age of 68 (IQR 54-79). Community infections dominated with 3249 (89.0\%) reports. Comorbidities were frequently reported: hypertension (1481 - 61.7\%), cardiovascular diseases (948 - 39.5\%), and diabetes (660 - 27.5\%) being the most frequent in adults; respiratory diseases and asthma (4 −21.1\%), haematological and oncological diseases (3 – 15.8\%) being the most frequent in children. Complications occurred in 2679 (73.4\%) episodes, mostly for respiratory diseases (2470 - 93.2\% in adults, 16 – 55.2\% in children), renal (681 – 25.7\%) and cardiac (631 – 23.8\%) complication for adults. The second and third most frequent complications in children affected the digestive system and the liver (7 - 24.1\%). A targeted treatment was given in 1299 (35.6\%) episodes, mostly with hydroxychloroquine (989 - 76.1\%). Intensive care units stays were reported in 578 (15.8\%) episodes. 527 (14.5\%) deaths were registered, all among adults.
          
          
            Conclusion
            The surveillance system has been successfully initiated and provides a very representative set of data for Switzerland. We therefore consider it to be a valuable addition to the existing mandatory reporting, providing more precise information on the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical course of these cases.},

	abstract = {Background
            SARS-CoV-2 entry into type II pneumocytes is depended on the TMPRSS2 proteolytic enzyme. The only known promoter of TMPRSS2 in humans is an androgen response element. As such, androgen sensitivity may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Previously, we have reported a retrospective cohort analysis demonstrating the protective effect of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARis) in COVID-19. Men using 5ARis were less likely to be admitted to the ICU than men not taking 5ARis. Additionally, men using 5ARis had drastically reduced frequency of symptoms compared to men not using 5ARis in an outpatient setting. Here we aim to determine if 5ARis will be a beneficial treatment if given after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
          
          
            Methods
            
              A double-blinded, randomized, prospective, investigational study of dutasteride for the treatment of COVID-19 (
              NCT04446429
              ). Subjects confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 were treated in an outpatient setting. Endpoints for the study were remission times for a predetermined set of symptoms: fever or feeling feverish, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, body pain or muscle pain/ache, fatigue, headache, nasal congestion, nasal discharge (runny nose), nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and loss of taste or smell (Ageusia or Anosmia).
            
          
          
            Results
            A total of 130 SARS-CoV-2 positive men were included in the study, 64 subjects in the dutasteride arm and 66 subjects in the placebo-controlled group. The differences in the average remission times for fatigue and anosmia or ageusia was statistically different between the groups (5.8 versus 10.1 days for fatigue and 7.3 versus 13.4 days for anosmia or ageusia, in dutasteride and placebo groups, respectively), however, the total remission time was significantly reduced for the men given dutasteride; 9.0 days versus 15.6 days in the placebo group (p {\textless} 0.001). Excluding loss of taste and smell the average total remission time was 7.3 days in the dutasteride group versus 11.7 in the placebo arm (p {\textless} 0.001).
          
          
            Conclusion
            The total remission time for men using 5ARis was significantly reduced compared to men not taking 5ARis.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            The association between cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, established CV disease (CVD), and susceptibility to CV complications or mortality in COVID-19 remains unclear.
          
          
            Methods
            
              We conducted a cohort study of consecutive adults hospitalised for severe COVID-19 between 1
              st
              March and 30
              th
              June 2020. Pre-existing CVD, CV risk factors and associations with mortality and CV complications were ascertained.
            
          
          
            Findings
            Among 1,721 patients (median age 71 years, 57\% male), 349 (20.3\%) had pre-existing CVD (CVD), 888 (51.6\%) had CV risk factors without CVD (RF-CVD), 484 (28.1\%) had neither. Patients with CVD were older with a higher burden of non-CV comorbidities. During follow-up, 438 (25.5\%) patients died: 37\% with CVD, 25.7\% with RF-CVD and 16.5\% with neither. CVD was independently associated with in-hospital mortality among patients {\textless}70 years of age (adjusted HR 2.43 [95\%CI 1.16-5.07]), but not in those ≥70 years (aHR 1.14 [95\%CI 0.77-1.69]). RF-CVD were not independently associated with mortality in either age group ({\textless}70y aHR 1.21 [95\%CI 0.72-2.01], ≥70y aHR 1.07 [95\%CI 0.76-1.52]). Most CV complications occurred in patients with CVD (66\%) versus RF-CVD (17\%) or neither (11\%; p{\textless}0.001). 213 [12.4\%] patients developed venous thromboembolism (VTE). CVD was not an independent predictor of VTE.
          
          
            Interpretation
            In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, pre-existing established CVD appears to be a more important contributor to mortality than CV risk factors in the absence of CVD. CVD-related hazard may be mediated, in part, by new CV complications. Optimal care and vigilance for destabilised CVD are essential in this patient group.},

            Background
            It is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We aimed to i) examine the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory virus infections a year previous; ii) compare current smoking in cases with age- and sex-matched London prevalence; and iii) examine concordance between smoking status recorded on the electronic health record (EHR) and the medical notes.
          
          
            Methods
            
              This retrospective case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, UK. London smoking prevalence was obtained from the representative Annual Population Survey. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another respiratory virus). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered on the
              Open Science Framework
              .
            
          
          
            Findings
            
              Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 had lower odds of being current smokers than patients admitted with other respiratory viruses (OR

            Objectives
            To address the generalisability of COVID-19’s outcomes to the well-defined but diverse communities of a single City area.
          
          
            Design
            An observational study of COVID-19 outcomes using quality-assured and integrated data from a single UK hospital contextualised to its feeder population and its associated factors (comorbidities, ethnicity, age, deprivation).
          
          
            Setting/Participants
            Single city hospital with a feeder population of 228,632 adults in Wolverhampton’s city area.
          
          
            Main Outcome Measures
            Hospital admissions and mortality.
          
          
            Results
            5558 patients admitted, 686 died (556 in hospital); 930 were COVID-19 admissions (CA),of which 270 were hospital COVID deaths, 47 non-COVID deaths, 36 deaths post-discharge; 4628 non-COVID-19 admissions (NCA), 239 in-hospital deaths (2 COVID), 94 deaths post-discharge. 223,074 adults not admitted, 407 died. Age, gender, multi-morbidity and Black ethnicity (OR 2.1 [95\% CI 1.5-3.2] p{\textless}0.001, absolute excess risk of {\textless}1/1,000) were associated with COVID-19 admission and mortality. The South Asian cohort had lower CA and NCA, lower mortality (CA (0.5 [0.3-0.8], p{\textless}0.01), NCA (0.4 [0.3-0.6] p{\textless}0.001), community deaths (0.5 [0.3-0.7] p{\textless}0.001). Despite many common risk factors for CA and NCA, ethnic groups had different admission rates, and within-groups differing association of risk factors. Deprivation impacted only in White ethnicity, in the oldest age bracket and in a lesser (not most) deprived quintile.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Wolverhampton’s results, reflecting high ethnic diversity and deprivation, are similar to other studies for Black ethnicity, age and comorbidity risk in COVID-19 but strikingly different in South Asians and for deprivation. Sequentially considering population and then hospital based NCA and CA outcomes, we present a complete single health-economy picture. Risk factors may differ within ethnic groups; our data may be more representative of communities with high BAME populations, highlighting the need for locally focussed public health strategies. We emphasise the need for a more comprehensible and nuanced conveyance of risk.
          
          
            Strengths and limitations of this study
            
              
                The rapidly developing COVID-19 pandemic has led to numerous studies (published, preprints and national public health reports) of its health impacts in relation to ethnicity, co-morbidities and other factors; few studies, however, have attempted to evaluate infection patient data in terms of morbidity and mortality in context of the feeder population and most are limited by incompleteness of data and inability to account for regional variations in factors such as ethnicity and deprivation
              
              
                Our observational study used a high quality and complete dataset from the local population and the hospital serving it to examine the association of purported risk factors with severity and mortality and the results reveal the importance of evaluating such risks in the local, and not just national, population setting taking into account the local variations in patient backgrounds
              
              
                We found an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality for Black ethnicity (OR 2.1) but a decreased risk (OR 0.5) for South Asians, compared with white ethnicity; Our analysis reveals that a nuanced approach to studying risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality is important – factoring in regional variation in ethnicity, deprivation etc. specifically linked to the source population
              
              
                We suggest, based on our findings, that understandably rapid analysis and dissemination of studies of COVID-19 risk needs to be tempered by careful consideration of the real implications; we further urge caution in conveying risk messages to the wider community because of an ethical imperative to ensure such messages do not lead to unnecessary fear and deter individuals, particularly from specific ethnic backgrounds, from seeking needed medical assistance.},

          COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits wide inter-individual clinical variability, from silent infection to severe disease and death. The identification of high-risk patients is a continuing challenge in routine care. We aimed to identify factors that influence clinical worsening. We analyzed 52 cell populations, 71 analytes, and RNA-seq gene expression in the blood of severe patients from the French COVID cohort upon hospitalization (n = 61). COVID-19 patients showed severe abnormalities of 27 cell populations relative to healthy donors (HDs). Forty-two cytokines, neutrophil chemo-attractants, and inflammatory components were elevated in COVID-19 patients. Supervised gene expression analyses showed differential expression of genes for neutrophil activation, interferon signaling, T- and B-cell receptors, EIF2 signaling, and ICOS-ICOSL pathways in COVID-19 patients. Unsupervised analysis confirmed the prominent role of neutrophil activation, with a high abundance of CD177, a specific neutrophil activation marker. CD177 was the most highly differentially-expressed gene contributing to the clustering of severe patients and its abundance correlated with CD177 protein serum levels. CD177 levels were higher in COVID-19 patients from both the French and “confirmatory” Swiss cohort (n = 203) than in HDs (P{\textless} 0.01) and in ICU than non-ICU patients (P{\textless} 0.001), correlating with the time to symptoms onset (P = 0.002). Longitudinal measurements showed sustained levels of serum CD177 to discriminate between patients with the worst prognosis, leading to death, and those who recovered (P = 0.01). These results highlight neutrophil activation as a hallmark of severe disease and CD177 assessment as a reliable prognostic marker for routine care.},

            Introduction
            Long-term effects of Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and their sustainability in a large number of patients are of the utmost relevance. We aimed to determine: 1)functional capacity of non-severe COVID-19 survivors by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); 2)those characteristics associated with worse CPET performance.
          
          
            Methods
            We prospectively enrolled the first 150 consecutive subjects with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection discharged alive from March to April 2020 at Azienda Sanitaria Locale (ASL)3, Genoa, Italy. At 3-month from hospital discharge, complete clinical evaluation, trans-thoracic echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), pulmonary function test (PFT), and dominant leg extension (DLE) maximal strength evaluation were performed.
          
          
            Results
            Excluding severe and incomplete/missing cases, 110 patients were analyzed. Median percent predicted peak oxygen uptake (\%pVO2) was 90.9(79.2-109.0)\%. Thirty-eight(34.5\%) patients had \%pVO2 below, whereas 72(65.5\%) above the 85\% predicted value (indicating normality). Median PFT parameters were within normal limits.
            Eight(21.1\%) patients had a mainly respiratory, 9(23.7\%) a mainly cardiac, 3(7.9\%) a mixed-cardiopulmonary, and 18(47.4\%) a non-cardiopulmonary limitation of exercise. Eighty-one(73.6\%) patients experimented at least one symptom, without relationship with \%pVO2 (p{\textgreater}0.05).
            Multivariate linear regression analysis showed age (β=0.46, p=0.020), percent weight loss (β=-0.77, p=0.029), active smoke status (β=-7.07, p=0.019), length of hospital stay (β=-0.20, p=0.042), and DLE maximal strength (β=1.65, p=0.039) independently associated with \%pVO2.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Half of non-severe COVID-19 survivors show functional capacity limitation mainly explained by muscular impairment, albeit cardiopulmonary causes are possible. These findings call for future research to identify patients at higher risk of long-term effects, that may benefit from careful surveillance and targeted rehabilitation.
          
          
            Take-home messages
            at 3-month cardiopulmonary exercise testing 38/110(34.5\%) non-severe COVID-19 survivors had percent predicted peak oxygen uptake (\%pVO2) {\textless} 85\% (indicating normality). Half of them had functional capacity limitation mainly explained by muscular impairment.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Importance
            Deaths among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are partially attributed to venous thromboembolism and arterial thromboses. Anticoagulants prevent thrombosis formation, possess anti-inflammatory and anti-viral properties, and may be particularly effective for treating patients with COVID-19.
          
          
            Objective
            To evaluate whether initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission is associated with decreased risk of death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
          
          
            Design
            Observational cohort study.
          
          
            Setting
            Nationwide cohort of patients receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States.
          
          
            Participants
            All patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection March 1 to July 31, 2020, without a history of therapeutic anticoagulation.
          
          
            Exposures
            Prophylactic doses of subcutaneous heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or direct oral anticoagulants.
          
          
            Main Outcomes and Measures
            30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: inpatient mortality and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation.
          
          
            Results
            Of 4,297 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 3,627 (84.4\%) received prophylactic anticoagulation within 24 hours of admission. More than 99\% (n=3,600) received subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin. We observed 622 deaths within 30 days of admission, 513 among those who received prophylactic anticoagulation. Most deaths (510/622, 82\%) occurred during hospitalization. In inverse probability of treatment weighted analyses, cumulative adjusted incidence of mortality at 30 days was 14.3\% (95\% CI 13.1-15.5) among those receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and 18.7\% (95\% CI 15.1-22.9) among those who did not. Compared to patients who did not receive prophylactic anticoagulation, those who did had a 27\% decreased risk for 30-day mortality (HR 0.73, 95\% CI 0.66-0.81). Similar associations were found for inpatient mortality and initiating therapeutic anticoagulation. Quantitative bias analysis demonstrated that results were robust to unmeasured confounding (e-value lower 95\% CI 1.77). Results persisted in a number of sensitivity analyses.
          
          
            Conclusions and Relevance
            Early initiation of prophylactic anticoagulation among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with a decreased risk of mortality. These findings provide strong real-world evidence to support guidelines recommending the use of prophylactic anticoagulation as initial therapy for COVID-19 patients upon hospital admission.},

            OBJECTIVE
            Our aim is to investigate high resolution CT features of COVID-19 infection in Abu Dhabi, UAE, and to compare the diagnostic performance of CT scan with RT-PCR test.
          
          
            METHODS
            Data of consecutive patients who were suspected to have COVID-19 infection and presented to our hospital, was collected from March 2, 2020, until April 12, 2020. All patients underwent RT-PCR test; out of which 53.8\% had chest CT scan done. Using RT-PCR as a standard reference, the sensitivity and specify of CT scan was calculated. We also analyzed the most common imaging findings in patients with positive RT-PCR results.
          
          
            RESULTS
            The typical HRCT findings were seen in 50 scans (65.8\%) out of total positive ones; 44 (77.2\%) with positive RT-PCR results and 6 (31.6\%) with negative results. The peripheral disease distribution was seen in 86\%, multilobe involvement in 70\%, bilateral in 82\%, and posterior in 82\% of the 50 scans.
            The ground glass opacities were seen in 50/74 (89.3\%) of positive RT-PCR group. The recognized GGO patterns in these scans were: rounded 50\%, linear 38\%, and crazy-paving 24\%.
            Using RT-PCR as a standard of reference, chest HRCT scan revealed sensitivity of 68.8\% and specificity of 70\%.
          
          
            CONCLUSION
            The commonest HRCT findings in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were peripheral, posterior, bilateral, multilobe rounded ground glass opacities.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created high demand for medical resources, including personnel, intensive care unit beds, and ventilators. As thousands of patients are hospitalized, the disease has shown remarkable diversity in its manifestation; many patients with mild to no symptoms recover from the disease requiring minimal care, but some patients with severe disease progression require mechanical ventilation support in intensive care units (ICU) with an increased risk of death. Studying the characteristics of patients in these various strata can help us understand the varied progression of this disease, enable earlier interventions for at-risk patients, and help manage medical resources more efficiently. This paper presents a retrospective analysis of 10,123 COVID-19 patients treated at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, including their demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory values, vital signs, and clinical history. Specifically, we present a staging scheme based on discrete clinical events (i.e., admission to the hospital, admission to the ICU, mechanical ventilation, and death), and investigate the temporal trend of clinical variables and the effect of comorbidities in each of those stages. We then developed a prognostic model to predict ventilation demands at an individual patient level by analyzing baseline clinical variables, which entails (1) a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and a decision tree model to identify predictors for mechanical ventilation; and (2) a logistic regression model based on these risk factors to predict which patients will eventually need ventilatory support. Our results indicate that the prognostic model achieves an AUC of 0.823 (95\% CI: 0.765–0.880) in identifying patients who will eventually require mechanical ventilation.},

            Patients with coronavirus disease-19 (
            COVID-19
            ) are at high risk for thrombotic arterial and venous occlusions. However, bleeding complications have also been observed in some patients. Understanding the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis will help inform optimal approaches to thrombosis prophylaxis and potential utility of fibrinolytic-targeted therapies. 118 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. We measured plasma antigen levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator
            (tPA
            ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (
            PAI-1
            ) and performed spontaneous clot-lysis assays. We found markedly elevated tPA and PAI-1 levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Both factors demonstrated strong correlations with neutrophil counts and markers of neutrophil activation. High levels of tPA and PAI-1 were associated with worse respiratory status. High levels of tPA, in particular, were strongly correlated with mortality and a significant enhancement in spontaneous
            ex vivo
            clot-lysis. While both tPA and PAI-1 are elevated among COVID-19 patients, extremely high levels of tPA enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis and are significantly associated with mortality in some patients. These data indicate that fibrinolytic homeostasis in COVID-19 is complex with a subset of patients expressing a balance of factors that may favor fibrinolysis. Further study of tPA as a biomarker is warranted.},

              Background
              Information on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized Covid-19 patients with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) is limited in the Arab region. This study aims to fill this gap.
            
            
              Methods
              In this single-center retrospective study, medical records of hospitalized adults with confirmed Covid-19 [RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV2] at King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC)-King Khaled University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia from May to July 2020 were analyzed. Clinical, radiological and serological information, as well as outcomes were recorded and analyzed.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 439 patients were included (median age 55 years; 68.3\% men). The most prevalent comorbidities were vitamin D deficiency (74.7\%), DM (68.3\%), hypertension (42.6\%) and obesity (42.2\%). During hospitalization, 77 out of the 439 patients (17.5\%) died. DM patients have a significantly higher death rate (20.5\% versus 12.3\%; p = 0.04) and lower survival time (p = 0.016) than non-DM. Multivariate cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that age [Hazards ratio, HR 3.0 (95\% confidence interval, CI 1.7–5.3); p {\textless} 0.001], congestive heart failure [adjusted HR 3.5 (CI 1.4–8.3); p = 0.006], smoking [adjusted HR 5.8 (CI 2.0–17.2); p {\textless} 0.001], β-blocker use [adjusted HR 1.7 (CI 1.0–2.9); p = 0.04], bilateral lung infiltrates [adjusted HR 1.9 (CI 1.1–3.3); p = 0.02], creatinine {\textgreater} 90 µmol/l [adjusted HR 2.1 (CI 1.3–3.5); p = 0.004] and 25(OH)D {\textless} 12.5 nmol/l [adjusted HR 7.0 (CI 1.7–28.2); p = 0.007] were significant predictors of mortality among hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Random blood glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/l was significantly associated with intensive care admission [adjusted HR 1.5 (CI 1.0–2.2); p = 0.04], as well as smoking, β-blocker use, neutrophil {\textgreater} 7.5, creatinine {\textgreater} 90 µmol/l and alanine aminotransferase {\textgreater} 65U/l.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The prevalence of DM is high among hospitalized Covid-19 patients in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. While DM patients have a higher mortality rate than their non-DM counterparts, other factors such as old age, congestive heart failure, smoking, β-blocker use, presence of bilateral lung infiltrates, elevated creatinine and severe vitamin D deficiency, appear to be more significant predictors of fatal outcome. Patients with acute metabolic dysfunctions, including hyperglycemia on admission are more likely to receive intensive care.},

            Background
            Patients with COVID-19 can develop myocardial injury and arrhythmia during the course of their illness. However, the underlying risk factors for the development of cardiovascular related manifestations are unclear.
          
          
            Methods
            Using a register-based multi-center cross-sectional design, we analyzed 80 patients with myocardial injury and 401 controls, as well as 71 patients with arrhythmia and 409 controls, all admitted with COVID-19. Putative risk factors for myocardial injury and arrhythmia were evaluated with logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders.
          
          
            Results
            COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury had fatigue (66.2\%) and dyspnea (63.7\%), while those with arrhythmia had dyspnea (71.8\%). Patients with myocardial injury and arrhythmia had a significant mortality of 92.5\% and 94.4\%, respectively. A history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart diseases was associated with an increased risk of myocardial injury (odds ratio [OR] = 1.94, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.71; OR = 7.43, 95\% CI: 3.99-13.83) and arrhythmia (OR = 1.94, 95\% CI: 1.00-3.75; OR = 13.16, 95\% CI: 6.75-25.68). In addition, we found that gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) {\textgreater}50U/L (OR = 2.14, 95\% CI: 1.37-3.32; OR = 1.85, 95\% CI: 1.19-2.85), serum creatinine {\textgreater}111μmol/L (OR = 8.96, 95\% CI: 4.4-18.23; OR = 3.71, 95\% CI: 2.01-6.85), serum sodium {\textless}136 mmol/L (OR = 4.68, 95\% CI: 2.46-8.91; OR = 2.06; 95\% CI: 1.06-4.00) were all associated with increased risk of myocardial injury and arrhythmia, respectively.
          
          
            Conclusion
            Our reported clinical characteristics and identified risk factors are important for clinical study of COVID-19 patients developing myocardial injury and arrhythmia.},

            Objectives
            To determine clinical course and outcomes in rheumatic disease patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and compare results to uninfected patients.
          
          
            Methods
            We conducted a case cohort study of autoimmune disease patients with COVID-19 (confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PCR) from 02/01/2020 to 07/31/2020 and compared them in a 1:3 ratio with uninfected patients who were matched based on race, age, sex, and comorbidity index. Patient demographics, clinical course, and outcomes were compared among these patient groups.
          
          
            Results
            A total of 70 rheumatic disease patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 56.6 years; 64\% African American) were identified. The 34 (49\%) patients who were hospitalized used oral glucocorticoids more frequently (p{\textless}0.01). All 10 patients on anti-TNFα medications were treated as outpatients (p{\textless}0.01). Those hospitalized with COVID-19 more often required ICU admission (17 (50\%) vs 27 (26\%), OR=2.78 (95\% CI: 1.24 to 6.20)) and intubation (10 (29\%) vs 6 (6\%), OR=6.67 (95\% CI: 2.20 to 20.16)) than uninfected patients. They also had higher mortality rates (6 (18\%) vs 3 (3\%), OR=7.21 (95\% CI: 1.70 to 30.69)). Of the six COVID-19 patients who died, one was of African ancestry (p=0.03).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Rheumatic disease patients infected with COVID-19 were more likely to require ICU admission, ventilation, and died more frequently versus uninfected patients with autoimmune disease. Patients on anti-TNFα medications were hospitalized less frequently while those on chronic glucocorticoids were hospitalized more frequently. These findings have important implications for medication choice in rheumatic disease patients during the ongoing spread of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Importance
            Understanding the false negative rates of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing is pivotal for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and it has practical implications for patient management in healthcare facilities.
          
          
            Objective
            To determine the real-life clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing.
          
          
            Design
            A retrospective study on case series from 4 March – 15 April 2020.
          
          
            Setting
            A population-based study conducted in primary and tertiary care in the Helsinki Capital Region, Finland.
          
          
            Participants
            Adults who were clinically suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection and underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, and who had sufficient data for grading of clinical suspicion of COVID-19 in their medical records were eligible. All 1,194 inpatients admitted to COVID-19 cohort wards during the study period were included. The outpatient cohort of 1,814 individuals was sampled from epidemiological line lists by systematic quasi-random sampling. Altogether 83 eligible outpatients (4.6\%) and 3 inpatients (0.3\%) were excluded due to insufficient data for grading of clinical suspicion.
          
          
            Exposures
            High clinical suspicion for COVID-19 was used as the reference standard for the RT-PCR test. Patients were considered to have high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 if the physician in charge recorded the suspicion on clinical grounds, or the patient fulfilled specifically defined clinical and exposure criteria.
          
          
            Main measures
            Sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR by using manually curated clinical characteristics as the gold standard.
          
          
            Results
            The study population included 1,814 outpatients (mean [SD] age, 45.4 [17.2] years; 69.1\% women) and 1,194 inpatients (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [18.3] years; 45.2\% women). The sensitivity (95\% CI) for laboratory confirmed cases, i.e. repeatedly tested patients were as follows: 85.7\% (81.5–89.1\%) inpatients; 95.5\% (92.2–97.5\%) outpatients, 89.9\% (88.2–92.1\%) all. When also patients that were graded as high suspicion but never tested positive were included in the denominator, the following sensitivity values (95\% CI) were observed: 67.5\% (62.9–71.9\%) inpatients; 34.9\% (31.4–38.5\%) outpatients; 47.3\% (44.4–50.3\%) all.
          
          
            Conclusions and relevance
            The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing was only moderate at best. The relatively high false negative rates of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing need to be accounted for in clinical decision making, epidemiological interpretations and when using RT-PCR as a reference for other tests.
          
          
            Key Points
            
              Question
              What is the clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test?
            
            
              Findings
              In this population-based retrospective study on medical records of 1,814 outpatients and 1,194 inpatients, the clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was 47.3–89.9\%.
            
            
              Meaning
              The false negative rates of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing need to be accounted for in clinical decision making, epidemiological interpretations and when using RT-PCR as a reference for other tests.},

	abstract = {Background
            COVID-19 is a newly recognized illness with a predominantly respiratory presentation. As winter approaches in the northern hemisphere, it is important to characterize the differences in disease presentation and trajectory between COVID-19 patients and other patients with common respiratory illnesses. These differences can enhance knowledge of pathogenesis and help in guiding treatment.
          
          
            Methods
            Data from electronic medical records were obtained from individuals admitted with respiratory illnesses to Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel, between October 1st, 2014 and September 1st, 2020. Four groups of patients were defined: COVID-19 (693), influenza (1,612), severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) (2,292) and Others (4,054). The variable analyzed include demographics (7), vital signs (8), lab tests (38), and comorbidities (15) from a total of 8,651 hospitalized adult patients. Statistical analysis was performed on biomarkers measured at admission and for their disease trajectory in the first 48 hours of hospitalization, and on comorobidity prevalence.
          
          
            Results
            COVID-19 patients were overall younger in age and had higher body mass index, compared to influenza and SARI. Comorbidity burden was lower in the COVID-19 group compared to influenza and SARI. Severely- and moderately-ill COVID-19 patients older than 65 years of age suffered higher rate of in-hospital mortality compared to hospitalized influenza patients. At admission, white blood cells and neutrophils were lower among COVID-19 patients compared to influenza and SARI patients, while pulse rate and lymphoctye percentage were higher. Trajectories of variables during the first two days of hospitalization revealed that white blood count, neutrophils percentage and glucose in blood increased among COVID-19 patients, while decreasing among other patients.
          
          
            Conclusions
            The intrinsic virulence of COVID-19 appeared higher than influenza. In addition, several critical functions, such as immune response, coagulation, heart and respiratory function and metabolism were uniquely affected by COVID-19.},

              Background
              In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many have flagged racial and ethnic differences in health outcomes in western countries as an urgent global public health priority. Kuwait has a unique demographic profile with two-thirds of the population consisting of non-nationals, most of which are migrant workers. We aimed to explore whether there is a significant difference in health outcomes between non-Kuwaiti and Kuwaiti patients diagnosed with COVID-19.
            
            
              Methods
              We used a prospective COVID-19 registry of all patients (symptomatic and asymptomatic) in Kuwait who tested positive from February 24th to April 20th, 2020, collected from Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, the officially-designated COVID-19 healthcare facility in the country. We ran separate logistic regression models comparing non-Kuwaitis to Kuwaitis for death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia.
            
            
              Results
              The first 1123 COVID-19 positive patients in Kuwait were all recruited in the study. About 26\% were Kuwaitis and 73\% were non-Kuwaiti. With adjustments made to age, gender, smoking and selected co-morbidities, non-Kuwaitis had two-fold increase in the odds of death or being admitted to the intensive care unit compared to Kuwaitis (OR: 2.14, 95\% CI 1.12–4.32). Non-Kuwaitis had also higher odds of ARDS (OR:2.44, 95\% CI 1.23–5.09) and pneumonia (OR: 2.24, 95\% CI 1.27–4.12).
            
            
              Conclusion
              This is the first study to report on COVID-19 outcomes between Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti patients. The current pandemic may have amplified the differences of health outcomes among marginalized subpopulations. A number of socioeconomic and environmental factors could explain this health disparity. More research is needed to advance the understanding of policymakers in Kuwait in order to make urgent public health interventions.},

            Background
            Whether diabetes is associated with COVID-19-related mortality remains unclear.
          
          
            Methods
            In this retrospective case-series study we examined the risk of death associated with self-reported diabetes in symptomatic adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were identified through the System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico from January 1 through November 4, 2020. Survival time was right-censored at 28 days of follow-up.
          
          
            Results
            Among 757,210 patients with COVID-19 included in the study, 120,476 (16\%) had diabetes and 80,616 died. Patients with diabetes had a 49\% higher relative risk of death than those without diabetes (Cox proportional-hazard ratio; 1.49 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-1.52), adjusting for age, sex, smoking habit, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and chronic renal disease. The relative risk of death associated with diabetes decreased with age (P=0.004). The hazard ratios were 1.66 (1.58-1.74) in outpatients and 1.14 (1.12-1.16) in hospitalized patients. The 28-day survival for inpatients with and without diabetes was, respectively, 73.5\% and 85.2\% for patients 20-39 years of age; 66.6\% and 75.9\% for patients 40-49 years of age; 59.4\% and 66.5\% for patients 50-59 years of age; 50.1\% and 54.6\% for patients 60-69 years of age; 42.7\% and 44.6\% for patients 70-79 years of age; and 38.4\% and 39.0\% for patients 80 years of age or older. In patients without COVID-19 (878,840), the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 1.78 (1.73-1.84).
          
          
            Conclusion
            In symptomatic adult patients with COVID-19 in Mexico, diabetes was associated with higher mortality. This association decreased with age.},

            Aim
            To determine whether healthcare workers (HCW) hospitalized in Spain due to COVID-19 have a worse prognosis than non-healthcare workers (NHCW).
          
          
            Methods
            Observational cohort study based on the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, a nationwide registry that collects sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data on patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Spain. Patients aged 20-65 years were selected. A multivariate logistic regression model was performed to identify factors associated with mortality.
          
          
            Results
            As of 22 May 2020, 4393 patients were included, of whom 419 (9.5\%) were HCW. Median (interquartile range) age of HCW was 52 (15) years and 62.4\% were women. Prevalence of comorbidities and severe radiological findings upon admission were less frequent in HCW. There were no difference in need of respiratory support and admission to intensive care unit, but occurrence of sepsis and in-hospital mortality was lower in HCW (1.7\% vs. 3.9\%; p=0.024 and 0.7\% vs. 4.8\%; p{\textless}0.001 respectively). Age, male sex and comorbidity, were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and healthcare working with lower mortality (OR 0.219, 95\%CI 0.069-0.693, p=0.01). 30-days survival was higher in HCW (0.968 vs. 0.851 p{\textless}0.001).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Hospitalized COVID-19 HCW had fewer comorbidities and a better prognosis than NHCW. Our results suggest that professional exposure to COVID-19 in HCW does not carry more clinical severity nor mortality.},

            INTRODUCTION
            Chronological age (CA) is a predictor of adverse COVID-19 outcomes; however, CA alone does not capture individual responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we evaluated the influence of aging metrics PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel to predict adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Furthermore, we sought to model adaptive metabolic and inflammatory responses to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection using individual PhenoAge components.
          
          
            METHODS
            In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed cases admitted to a COVID-19 reference center in Mexico City. PhenoAge and PhenoAgeAccel were estimated using laboratory values at admission. Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to estimate risk for COVID-19 lethality and adverse outcomes (ICU admission, intubation, or death). To explore reproducible patterns which model adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used k-means clustering using PhenoAge/PhenoAccelAge components.
          
          
            RESULTS
            
              We included 1068 subjects of whom 401 presented critical illness and 204 died. PhenoAge was a better predictor of adverse outcomes and lethality compared to CA and SpO
              2
              and its predictive capacity was sustained for all age groups. Patients with responses associated to PhenoAgeAccel{\textgreater}0 had higher risk of death and critical illness compared to those with lower values (log-rank p{\textless}0.001). Using unsupervised clustering we identified four adaptive responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection: 1) Inflammaging associated with CA, 2) metabolic dysfunction associated with cardio-metabolic comorbidities, 3) unfavorable hematological response, and 4) response associated with favorable outcomes.
            
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            Adaptive responses related to accelerated aging metrics are linked to adverse COVID-19 outcomes and have unique and distinguishable features. PhenoAge is a better predictor of adverse outcomes compared to CA.},

	abstract = {Many countries have seen a two-wave pattern in reported cases of coronavirus disease-19 during the 2020 pandemic, with a first wave during spring followed by the current second wave in late summer and autumn. Empirical data show that the characteristics of the effects of the virus do vary between the two periods. Differences in age range and severity of the disease have been reported, although the comparative characteristics of the two waves still remain largely unknown. Those characteristics are compared in this study using data from two equal periods of 3 and a half months. The first period, between 15th March and 30th June, corresponding to the entire first wave, and the second, between 1st July and 15th October, corresponding to part of the second wave, still present at the time of writing this article. Two hundred and four patients were hospitalized during the first period, and 264 during the second period. Patients in the second wave were younger and the duration of hospitalization and case fatality rate were lower than those in the first wave. In the second wave, there were more children, and pregnant and post-partum women. The most frequent signs and symptoms in both waves were fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cough, and the most relevant comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic neurological diseases. Patients from the second wave more frequently presented renal and gastrointestinal symptoms, were more often treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and corticoids, and less often with invasive mechanical ventilation, conventional oxygen therapy and anticoagulants. Several differences in mortality risk factors were also observed. These results might help to understand the characteristics of the second wave and the behaviour and danger of SARS-CoV-2 in the Mediterranean area and in Western Europe. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.},

            PURPOSE
            Clinical course in COVID-19 patients is uncertain. This study investigated possible early prognostic factors among middle-aged and older adult and explored prognostic rules stratifying risk of patients.
          
          
            METHODS
            Community-based retrospective cohort study that included 282 community-dwelling symptomatic patients ≥50 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (hospitalised and/or outpatient) during March-June 2020 in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain). Relationship between demographics, pre-existing comorbidities and early symptomatology (first 5-days) and risk of suffering critical outcome (ICU-admission/death) across clinical course was evaluated by logistic regression analyses, and simple predictive models were developed.
          
          
            RESULTS
            Of the 282 cases (mean age: 65.9 years; 140 men), 154 (54.6\%) were hospitalised (30 ICU-admitted) and 45 (16\%) deceased. In crude analyses, increasing age, male sex, some comorbidities (renal, respiratory or cardiac disease, diabetes and hypertension) and symptoms (confusion, dyspnea) were associated with an increased risk to suffer critical outcome, whereas other symptoms (rinorrhea, myalgias, headache, anosmia/disgeusia) were related with reduced risk. After multivariable-adjustment only age/years (OR: 1.04; 95\% CI: 1.01-1.07; p=0.004), confusion (OR: 5.33; 95\% CI: 1.54-18.48; p=0.008), dyspnea (OR: 5.41; 95\% CI: 2.74-10.69; p{\textless}0.001) and myalgias (OR: 0.30; 95\% CI: 0.10-0.93; p=0.038) remained significantly associated with increased or reduced risk. A proposed CD65-M prognostic rule (including the above mentioned 4 variables) showed a good correlation with the risk of suffering critical outcome (area under ROC curve: 0.828; 95\% CI: 0.774-0.882).
          
          
            CONCLUSION
            Clinical course of COVID-19 is early unpredictable, but simple clinical tools as the proposed CD65-M rule (pending external validation) may be helpful assessing these patients in primary care settings.},

              Background
              People experiencing homelessness are at increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but little is known about specific risk factors for infection within homeless shelters.
            
            
              Methods
              We performed widespread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction testing and collected risk factor information at all homeless shelters in Chicago with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 (n = 21). Multivariable, mixed-effects log-binomial models were built to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection for both individual- and facility-level risk factors.
            
            
              Results
              During March 1 to May 1, 2020, 1717 shelter residents and staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 472 (27\%) persons tested positive. Prevalence of infection was higher for residents (431 of 1435, 30\%) than for staff (41 of 282, 15\%) (prevalence ratio = 2.52; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.78–3.58). The majority of residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection (293 of 406 with available information about symptoms, 72\%) reported no symptoms at the time of specimen collection or within the following 2 weeks. Among residents, sharing a room with a large number of people was associated with increased likelihood of infection (aPR for sharing with \&gt;20 people compared with single rooms = 1.76; 95\% CI, 1.11–2.80), and current smoking was associated with reduced likelihood of infection (aPR = 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.60–0.85). At the facility level, a higher proportion of residents leaving and returning each day was associated with increased prevalence (aPR = 1.08; 95\% CI, 1.01–1.16), whereas an increase in the number of private bathrooms was associated with reduced prevalence (aPR for 1 additional private bathroom per 100 people = 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.87–0.98).
            
            
              Conclusions
              We identified a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in homeless shelters. Reducing the number of residents sharing dormitories might reduce the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection. When community transmission is high, limiting movement of persons experiencing homelessness into and out of shelters might also be beneficial.},

              To investigate possible relationships between pre-existing medical conditions (including common comorbidities and chronic medications) and risk for suffering COVID-19 disease in middle-aged and older adults.
            
            
              Design
              Population-based retrospective cohort study.
            
            
              Setting
              Twelve primary care centres (PCCs) in Tarragona (Spain).
            
            
              Participants
              79 083 people (77 676 community-dwelling and 1407 nursing-home residents), who were all individuals aged {\textgreater}50 years affiliated to the 12 participating PCCs.
            
            
              Outcomes
              Baseline cohort characteristics (age, sex, vaccinations, comorbidities and chronic medications) were established at study start (1st. March 2020) and primary outcome was time to COVID-19 confirmed by PCR among cohort members throughout the epidemic period (from 1st. March 2020 to 23rd. May 2020). Risk for suffering COVID-19 was evaluated by Cox regression, estimating multivariable HRs adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities and medications use.
            
            
              Results
              During the study period, 2324 cohort members were PCR-tested, with 1944 negative and 380 positive results, which means an incidence of 480.5 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100 000 persons-period. Assessing the total study cohort, only age (HR 1.02; 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.03; p=0.002), nursing-home residence (HR 21.83; 95\% CI 16.66 to 28.61; p{\textless}0.001) and receiving diuretics (HR 1.35; 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.76; p=0.026) appeared independently associated with increased risk. Smoking (HR 0.62; 95\% CI 0.41 to 0.93; p=0.022), ACE inhibitors (HR 0.68; 95\% CI 0.47 to 0.99; p=0.046) and antihistamine (HR 0.47; 95\% CI 0.22 to 1.01; p=0.052) were associated with a lower risk. Among community-dwelling individuals, cancer (HR 1.52; 95\% CI 1.03 to 2.24; p=0.035), chronic respiratory disease (HR 1.82; 95\% CI 1.08 to 3.07; p=0.025) and cardiac disease (HR 1.53; 95\% CI 1.06 to 2.19; p=0.021) emerged to be also associated with an increased risk. Receiving ACE inhibitors (HR 0.66; 95\% CI 0.44 to 0.99; p=0.046) and influenza vaccination (HR 0.63; 95\% CI 0.44 to 0.91; p=0.012) was associated with decreased risk.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Age, nursing-home residence and multiple comorbidities appear predisposing for COVID-19. Conversely, receiving ACE inhibitors, antihistamine and influenza vaccination could be protective, which should be closely investigated in further studies specifically focused on these concerns.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              Smoking causes inflammation of the lung epithelium by releasing cytokines and impairing mucociliary clearance. Some studies have linked smoking with severity of illness of COVID-19 whereas others have found no such association.
            
            
              Methods
              This was a retrospective analysis of all adults hospitalised with COVID-19 from 9 March to 18 May 2020.
            
            
              Results
              1173 patients met the study criteria. 837 patients never smoked whereas 336 patients were either current smokers or past smoker and were grouped together in smokers group. Patients in smokers group were more likely to be male and had higher incidence of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (19\% vs 6\%, p{\textless}0.001), HIV infection (11\% vs 5\%,p{\textless}0.001), cancer (11\% vs 6\%, p=0.005), congestive heart failure (15\% vs 8\%, p{\textless}0.001), coronary artery disease (15\% vs 9\%, p=0.3), chronic kidney disease (11\% vs 8\%, p=0.037) and end-stage renal disease (10\% vs 6\%, p=0.009) compared with non-smokers. Outcome analysis showed that smokers were more likely to develop critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation (47\% vs 37\% p=0.005). Univariate Cox model for survival analysis by smoking status showed that among smokers only current smokers had higher risk of death compared with never smokers (HR 1.61, 95\% CI 1.22 to 2.12, p{\textless}0.001). In the multivariate approach, Cox model for the survival, female sex, young age, low serum lactate dehydrogenase and systemic steroid use were associated with overall improved survival.
            
            
              Conclusion
              In our large single-centre retrospective database of patients hospitalised with COVID-19, smoking was associated with development of critical illness and higher likelihood of death.},

Methods: We retrospectively collected clinical information from 1968 patients admitted to a hospital. We built a predictive score based on a logistic regression model in which explicative variables were discretized using classification trees that facilitated the identification of the optimal sections in order to predict inpatient mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19. These sections were translated into a score indicating the probability of a patient’s death, thus making the results easy to interpret. Results. Median age was 67 years, 1104 patients (56.4\%) were male, and 325 (16.5\%) died during hospitalization. Our final model identified nine key features: age, oxygen saturation, smoking, serum creatinine, lymphocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, C-reactive protein, and sodium at admission. The discrimination of the model was excellent in the training, validation, and test samples (AUC: 0.865, 0.808, and 0.883, respectively). We constructed a prognostic scale to determine the probability of death associated with each score. Conclusions: We designed an easily applicable predictive model for early identification of patients at high risk of death due to COVID-19 during hospitalization.},

            To examine the association between dexamethasone use and mortality among hospitalized patients for COVID-19.
          
          
            Design
            Multicenter observational retrospective cohort study.
          
          
            Setting
            Greater Paris University hospitals, France.
          
          
            Participants
            12,217 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 between 24 January and 20 May 2020, including 171 patients (1.4\%) who received dexamethasone orally or by intravenous perfusion during the visit.
          
          
            Data source
            Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris Health Data Warehouse.
          
          
            Main outcome measures
            The primary endpoint was time to death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received dexamethasone and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusting for sex, age, obesity, current smoking status, any medical condition associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality, and clinical and biological severity of COVID-19 at admission, while stratifying by the need of respiratory support (i.e., oxygen or intubation). The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox model and the secondary analysis used a univariate Cox regression in a matched analytic sample.
          
          
            Results
            Among patients who required respiratory support, the end-point event of death occurred in 10 patients (15.9\%) who received dexamethasone and 298 patients (26.4\%) who did not. In this group of patients, there was a significant association between dexamethasone use and reduced mortality in both the crude, unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio (HR), 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.18 to 0.87, p=0.021) and the adjusted multivariable analysis (HR, 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.22 to 0.96, p=0.039). In the sensitivity analysis, the univariate Cox regression model in the matched analytic sample yielded a same tendency, albeit non-significant (HR, 0.31; 95\% CI, 0.08 to 1.14, p=0.077). Among patients without respiratory support, the end-point event of death occurred in 14 patients (13.0\%) who received dexamethasone and 1,086 patients (10.0\%) who did not. In this group of patients, there was no significant association between dexamethasone use and the endpoint. When examining the association between the cumulative dose of dexamethasone received during the visit and the endpoint, we found that the administration of a cumulative dose between 60 mg to 150 mg among patients who required respiratory support was significantly associated with a lower risk of death in the crude, unadjusted analysis (HR, 0.28; SE, 0.58, p=0.028), the adjusted multivariable analysis (HR, 0.24; SE, 0.65, p=0.030), and in the univariate Cox regression model in the matched analytic sample (HR, 0.32; SE, 0.58, p=0.048), whereas no significant association was observed with a different dose. Among patients without respiratory support, there was no significant association between the cumulative dose of dexamethasone and the endpoint in the crude and in the adjusted multivariable analyses.
          
          
            Conclusions
            In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, dexamethasone use administered either orally or by intravenous injection at a cumulative dose between 60 mg and 150 mg was associated with decreased mortality among those requiring respiratory support.},

	abstract = {Introduction
            
              Does smoking decrease the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 because the never-smokers (84\%) prevalence is high and the current-smokers prevalence is low among COVID-19 positive patients?
              1,2,3,4,5,6
              We sought to determine whether never smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 positivity among the 50 to 69-year old patients because they are more likely to test positive for COVID-19.
              7
            
          
          
            Method
            We conducted a retrospective chart review of COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction, in-hospital tested ≥18-year-old patients. A Poisson regression analysis stratified into never-smokers and history of smoking (current + former smokers) was conducted.
          
          
            Results
            277 COVID-19 negative and 117 COVID-19 positive patients’ charts with a never-smokers prevalence of 42.32\% and 54\% respectively were analyzed. The never-smokers prevalence was 54\%, 20-39-years; 61 \%, 40 -49-years; 41\%, 50 – 69-years; and 43\%, 70 – 100-years.
            The 40-49-year-old current and former smokers were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 [1.309 (1.047 - 1.635)], unlike the 40-49-year-old never-smokers [0.976 (0.890-1.071)] who had a lower risk.
            Regardless of their smoking status, males [1.084(1.021 - 1.151)] and the 50-69-year-old patients [1.082 (1.014 -1.154)] were more likely to test positive for COVID-19, while end stage renal disease [0.908(0.843-0.978)] and non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness [0.907 (0.863 - 0.953)] patients had a lower risk of COVID-19 positivity.
            Heart failure [0.907 (0.830 - 0.991)], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [0.842 (0.745 - 0.952)] and Parkinson’s disease [0.823 (0.708 - 0.957)] never-smokers were less likely to test positive for COVID-19.
          
          
            Conclusion
            This is the first study to show that smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 positivity among the 40-49-year-old patients, while not smoking reduces the risk of COVID-19 positivity among the heart failure, COPD and Parkinson’s disease patients. This study emphasizes that COVID-19 positivity risk is not reduced by smoking and not increased by not smoking.},

            Background
            As coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading globally, several countries are handling dengue epidemics. As both infections are deemed to share similarities at presentation, it would be useful to distinguish COVID-19 from dengue in the context of co-epidemics. In this aim, we performed a cohort study to identify predictors of both infections.
          
          
            Methods
            All the subjects suspected of COVID-19 between March 23 and May 10, 2020, were screened for COVID-19 within the testing center of the University hospital of Saint-Pierre, Reunion island. The screening consisted in a questionnaire surveyed in face-to-face, a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain-reaction and a rapid diagnostic orientation test for dengue. Factors independently associated with COVID-19 or with dengue were sought using multinomial logistic regression models, taking other febrile illnesses (OFIs) as controls.
          
          
            Results
            Over a two-month study period, we identified among 80 COVID-19, 60 non-severe dengue and 872 OFIs cases, delayed presentation ({\textgreater}3 days) since symptom onset (Odds ratio 1.89, 95\% confidence interval 1.4-3.40), contact with a COVID-19 positive case (OR 3.81, 95\%CI 2.12-6.82) and anosmia (OR 8.27, 95\%CI 4.39-15.54) as independent predictors of COVID-19, body ache (OR 6.83, 95\%CI 2.84-16.41), headache (OR 5.38, 95\%CI 1.81-15.94) and retro-orbital pain (OR 7.45, 95\%CI 3.17-17.50) as independent predictors of dengue, while smoking was less likely observed with COVID-19 (OR 0.27, 95\%CI 0.10-0.74).
          
          
            Conclusions
            Although prone to potential biases, these data suggest that non-severe dengue may be more symptomatic than COVID-19 in a co-epidemic setting with higher dengue attack rates.
          
          
            40-word summary of the article’s main point
            In the COVID-19 dengue co-epidemic setting of Reunion island, dengue was found more symptomatic than COVID-19 and associated with body ache, headache and retro-orbital pain, while COVID-19 was found associated with contact, anosmia, delayed presentation and absence of active smoking.},

            OBJECTIVE
            To develop and validate a prediction model, based on clinical history and examination findings on initial diagnosis of COVID-19, to identify patients at risk of critical outcomes.
          
          
            DESIGN
            National multicenter cohort study.
          
          
            SETTING
            Data from the SEMI (Sociedad Española de Medicina Interna) COVID-19 Registry, a nationwide cohort of consecutive COVID-19 patients presenting in 132 centers between March 23 and May 21, 2020. Model development used data from hospitals with ≥300 beds, and validation used those from hospitals with {\textless}300 beds.
          
          
            PARTICIPANTS
            Adults (age ≥18 years) presenting with COVID-19 diagnosis.
          
          
            MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE
            Composite of in-hospital death, mechanical ventilation or admission to intensive care unit.
          
          
            RESULTS
            
              There were 10,433 patients, 7,850 (main outcome rate 25.1\%) in the model development cohort and 2,583 (main outcome rate 27.0\%) in the validation cohort. The clinical variables in the final model were: age, cardiovascular disease, moderate or severe chronic kidney disease, dyspnea, tachypnea, confusion, systolic blood pressure, and SpO
              2
              ≤93\% or supplementary oxygen requirement at presentation. The model developed had C-statistic of 0.823 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.813 to 0.834) and calibration slope of 0.995. The external validation had C-statistic of 0.792 (95\% CI, 0.772 to 0.812) and calibration slope of 0.872. The model showed positive net benefit in terms of hospitalizations avoided for the predicted probability thresholds between 3\% and 79\%.
            
          
          
            CONCLUSIONS
            Among patients presenting with COVID-19, easily-obtained basic clinical information had good discrimination for identifying patients at risk of critical outcomes, and the model showed good generalizability. A model-based online prediction calculator provided with this paper would facilitate triage of patients during the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Being a newly emerging disease little is known about its long-lasting post COVID-19 consequences. Aim of this work is to assess the frequency, patterns and determinants of persistent post COVID-19 symptoms and to evaluate the value of a proposed Novel COVID-19 symptoms score. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the registry were included in a cross sectional study. The patient demographics, comorbid disorders, the mean duration since the onset of the symptoms, history of hospital or ICU admittance, and treatment taken during acute state, as well as symptoms score before and after convalescence were recorded.
          
          
            Results
            The most frequent constitutional and neurological symptoms were myalgia (60.0\%), arthralgia (57.2\%), restriction of daily activities (57.0\%), sleeping troubles (50.9\%), followed by anorexia (42.6\%), chest pain (32.6\%), gastritis (32.3\%), cough (29.3\%) and dyspnea (29.1\%). The mean total score of acute stage symptoms was 31.0 ± 16.3 while post COVID 19 symptoms score was 13.1±12.6 (P{\textless}0.001). The main determinants of the persistent post COVID-19 symptoms were the need for oxygen therapy (P{\textless}0.001), pre-existing hypertension (P=0.039), chronic pulmonary disorders (P=0.012), and any chronic comorbidity (P=0.004). There was a correlation between the symptom score during the acute attack and post COVID-19 stage (P{\textless}0.001, r=0.67). The acute phase score had 83.5\% sensitivity and 73.3\% specificity for the cutoff point {\textgreater} 18 to predict occurrence of Post-COVID-19 symptoms.
          
          
            Conclusions
            COVID-19 can present with a diverse spectrum of long-term post COVID-19 symptoms. Increased acute phase symptom severity and COVID-19 symptom score {\textgreater} 18 together with the presence of any comorbid diseases increase the risk for persistent post COVID-19 manifestations and severity.},

	abstract = {Background
              Prioritizing patients in need of intensive care is necessary to reduce the mortality rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although several scoring methods have been introduced, many require laboratory or radiographic findings that are not always easily available.
            
            
              Objective
              The purpose of this study was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the need for intensive care for patients with COVID-19 using easily obtainable characteristics—baseline demographics, comorbidities, and symptoms.
            
            
              Methods
              A retrospective study was performed using a nationwide cohort in South Korea. Patients admitted to 100 hospitals from January 25, 2020, to June 3, 2020, were included. Patient information was collected retrospectively by the attending physicians in each hospital and uploaded to an online case report form. Variables that could be easily provided were extracted. The variables were age, sex, smoking history, body temperature, comorbidities, activities of daily living, and symptoms. The primary outcome was the need for intensive care, defined as admission to the intensive care unit, use of extracorporeal life support, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, or death within 30 days of hospitalization. Patients admitted until March 20, 2020, were included in the derivation group to develop prediction models using an automated machine learning technique. The models were externally validated in patients admitted after March 21, 2020. The machine learning model with the best discrimination performance was selected and compared against the CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and 65 years of age or older) score using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
            
            
              Results
              A total of 4787 patients were included in the analysis, of which 3294 were assigned to the derivation group and 1493 to the validation group. Among the 4787 patients, 460 (9.6\%) patients needed intensive care. Of the 55 machine learning models developed, the XGBoost model revealed the highest discrimination performance. The AUC of the XGBoost model was 0.897 (95\% CI 0.877-0.917) for the derivation group and 0.885 (95\% CI 0.855-0.915) for the validation group. Both the AUCs were superior to those of CURB-65, which were 0.836 (95\% CI 0.825-0.847) and 0.843 (95\% CI 0.829-0.857), respectively.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We developed a machine learning model comprising simple patient-provided characteristics, which can efficiently predict the need for intensive care among patients with COVID-19.},

          We collected a multi-centric retrospective dataset of patients (N = 213) who were admitted to ten hospitals in Czech Republic and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The dataset contains baseline patient characteristics, breathing support required, pharmacological treatment received and multiple markers on daily resolution. Patients in the dataset were treated with hydroxychloroquine (N = 108), azithromycin (N = 72), favipiravir (N = 9), convalescent plasma (N = 7), dexamethasone (N = 4) and remdesivir (N = 3), often in combination. Most patients were admitted during the first wave of the epidemic. To explore association between treatments and patient outcomes we performed multiverse analysis, observing how the conclusions change between defensible choices of statistical model, predictors included in the model and other analytical degrees of freedom. Weak evidence to constrain the potential efficacy of azithromycin and favipiravir can be extracted from the data. Additionally, we performed external validation of several proposed prognostic models for Covid-19 severity showing that they mostly perform unsatisfactorily on our dataset.},

            Background
            It is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We aimed to i) examine the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory virus infections a year previous; ii) compare current smoking in cases with age- and sex-matched London prevalence; and iii) examine concordance between smoking status recorded on the electronic health record (EHR) and the medical notes.
          
          
            Methods
            
              This retrospective case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, UK. London smoking prevalence was obtained from the representative Annual Population Survey. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another respiratory virus). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered on the
              Open Science Framework
              .
            
          
          
            Findings
            
              Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 had lower odds of being current smokers than patients admitted with other respiratory viruses (OR

              Background
              Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health emergency. Here, we developed and validated a practical model based on the data from a multi-center cohort in China for early identification and prediction of which patients will be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
            
            
              Methods
              Data of 1087 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were collected from 49 sites between January 2 and February 28, 2020, in Sichuan and Wuhan. Patients were randomly categorized into the training and validation cohorts (7:3). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and logistic regression analyzes were used to develop the nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated for the C-index, calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. Further, the nomogram was externally validated in a different cohort.
            
            
              Results
              The individualized prediction nomogram included 6 predictors: age, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, fever, and chronic kidney disease. The model demonstrated a high discriminative ability in the training cohort (C-index = 0.829), which was confirmed in the external validation cohort (C-index = 0.776). In addition, the calibration plots confirmed good concordance for predicting the risk of ICU admission. Decision curve analysis revealed that the prediction nomogram was clinically useful.
            
            
              Conclusion
              We established an early prediction model incorporating clinical characteristics that could be quickly obtained on hospital admission, even in community health centers. This model can be conveniently used to predict the individual risk for ICU admission of patients with COVID-19 and optimize the use of limited resources.},

              Purpose
              Knowledge regarding patients’ clinical condition at severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection is sparse. Data in the international, multicenter Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2-Infected Patients (LEOSS) cohort study may enhance the understanding of COVID-19.
            
            
              Methods
              Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, enrolled in the LEOSS cohort study between March 16, 2020, and May 14, 2020, were analyzed. Associations between baseline characteristics and clinical stages at diagnosis (uncomplicated vs. complicated) were assessed using logistic regression models.
            
            
              Results
              
                We included 2155 patients, 59.7\% (1,287/2,155) were male; the most common age category was 66–85 years (39.6\%; 500/2,155). The primary COVID-19 diagnosis was made in 35.0\% (755/2,155) during complicated clinical stages. A significant univariate association between age; sex; body mass index; smoking; diabetes; cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, and kidney diseases; ACE inhibitor therapy; statin intake and an increased risk for complicated clinical stages of COVID-19 at diagnosis was found. Multivariable analysis revealed that advanced age [46–65 years: adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.73, 95\% CI 1.25–2.42,
                p
                 = 0.001; 66–85 years: aOR 1.93, 95\% CI 1.36–2.74,

                p
                 {\textless} 0.001 vs. individuals aged 26–45 years], male sex (aOR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.01–1.50,
                p
                 = 0.040), cardiovascular disease (aOR 1.37, 95\% CI 1.09–1.72,
                p
                 = 0.007), and diabetes (aOR 1.33, 95\% CI 1.04–1.69,
                p
                 = 0.023) were associated with complicated stages of COVID-19 at diagnosis.
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              The LEOSS cohort identified age, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and male sex as risk factors for complicated disease stages at SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, thus confirming previous data. Further data regarding outcomes of the natural course of COVID-19 and the influence of treatment are required.},

	abstract = {Background: Physical activity (PA) is known to be a protective lifestyle factor against several non-communicable diseases while its impact on infectious diseases, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not as clear.
Methods: We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify associations between both objectively and subjectively measured PA collected prospectively and COVID-19 related outcomes (overall COVID-19, inpatient COVID-19, outpatient COVID-19, and COVID-19 death) in the UK Biobank cohort. Subsequently, we tested causality by using Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses.
Results: In the multivariable model, the increased acceleration vector magnitude PA (AMPA) is associated with a decreased probability of overall and outpatient COVID-19 with an odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) of 0.80 (0.69, 0.93) and 0.74 (0.58, 0.95), respectively. No association is found between self-reported moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and COVID-19 related outcomes. No association is found by MR analyses.
Conclusions: Our results indicate a protective effect of objectively measured PA and COVID-19 outcomes (outpatient COVID-19 and overall COVID-19) independent of age, sex, measures of obesity, and smoking status. Although the MR analyses do not support a causal association, that may be due to limited power. We conclude that policies to encourage and facilitate exercise at a population level during the pandemic should be considered.},

              This study was performed to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
            
            
              Methods
              We analyzed the electronic medical records of 405 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in the Third Hospital of Wuhan.
            
            
              Results
              The patients’ median age was 56 years, 54.1\% were female, 11.4\% had a history of smoking, and 10.6\% had a history of drinking. All cases of COVID-19 were community-acquired. Fever (76.8\%) and cough (53.3\%) were the most common clinical manifestations, and circulatory system diseases were the most common comorbidities. Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 61.2\% of the patients, and 2.9\% of the patients were asymptomatic. Computed tomography showed ground-glass opacities in most patients (72.6\%) and consolidation in 30.9\%. Lymphopenia (72.3\%) and hypoproteinemia (71.6\%) were observed in most patients. About 20\% of patients had abnormal liver function. Patients with severe disease had significantly more prominent laboratory abnormalities, including an abnormal lymphocyte count and abnormal C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, D-dimer, and albumin levels.
            
            
              Conclusion
              SARS-CoV-2 causes a variety of severe respiratory illnesses similar to those caused by SARS-CoV-1. Older age, chronic comorbidities, and laboratory abnormalities are associated with disease severity.},

We show that urban-adapted mammals have more documented pathogens — and more zoonoses — even when considering a correlated suite of phenotypic, taxonomic, and geographic predictors. However, contrary to predictions, path analysis revealed that urban-adapted species do not host more zoonoses than expected given their total observed pathogen richness. We conclude that extended historical contact with humans has had a limited impact on the number of observed zoonoses in urbanadapted mammals. Instead, their greater observed zoonotic richness likely reflects either sampling bias due to greater cultural awareness and physical proximity to humans, or increased baseline pathogen diversity arising from the physiological and ecological consequences of urban living.},

	abstract = {Analyses of life-history, ecological, and geographic trait differences among species, their causes, correlates, and likely consequences are increasingly important for understanding and conserving biodiversity in the face of rapid global change. Assembling multispecies trait data from diverse literature sources into a single comprehensive data set requires detailed consideration of methods to reliably compile data for particular species, and to derive single estimates from multiple sources based on different techniques and definitions. Here we describe PanTHERIA, a species-level data set compiled for analysis of life history, ecology, and geography of all known extant and recently extinct mammals. PanTHERIA is derived from a database capable of holding multiple geo-referenced values for variables within a species containing 100 740 lines of biological data for extant and recently extinct mammalian species, collected over a period of three years by 20 individuals. PanTHERIA also includes spatial databases of mammalian geographic ranges and global climatic and anthropogenic variables. Here we detail how the data fields are extracted and defined for PanTHERIA using a customized data input format (MammalForm); how data were collected from the literature, species names and sources tracked, error-checking and validation procedures applied, and how data were consolidated into species-level values for each variable. Tables of the consolidated species-level values are made available for each of two recent species-level taxonomic classifications of mammals, as well as associated taxonomic synonymy conversion and data-input files. This study provides a useful guide to prospective researchers on how to structure and codify life-history, ecological, geographic, and taxonomic data and methods to extract meaningful species-level traits. It also provides comprehensive information on traits like size, diet, environmental conditions, and ecology to permit macroecological and macroevolutionary analyses of this important clade.

	abstract = {Forecasting how the risk of pathogen spillover changes over space is essential for the effective deployment of interventions such as human or wildlife vaccination. However, due to the sporadic nature of spillover events and limited availability of data, developing and validating robust predictions is challenging. Recent efforts to overcome this obstacle have capitalized on machine learning to predict spillover risk. Past approaches combine infection data from both humans and reservoir to train models that assess risk across broad geographical regions. In doing so, these models blend data sources that separately describe pathogen risk posed by the reservoir and the realized rate of spillover into the human population. We develop a novel approach that models as separate stages: 1) the contributions of spillover risk from the reservoir and pathogen distribution, and 2) the resulting incidence of pathogen in the human population. Our methodology allows for a rigorous assessment of whether forecasts of spillover risk can reliably predict the realized spillover rate into humans, as measured by seroprevalence. In addition to providing a rigorous cross-validation of risk predictions, this methodology could shed light on human habits that modulate or amplify the resultant spillover. We apply our method to Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that poses a high threat of emergence in West Africa. The resulting framework is the first forecast to quantify the extent to which predictions of spillover risk from the reservoir explain regional variation in human seroprevalence. We use predictions generated by the model to revise existing estimates for the annual number of new human Lassa infections. Our model predicts that between 935,200 –3,928,000 humans are infected by Lassa virus each year, an estimate that exceeds current conventional wisdom.},

	abstract = {A goal of many research programmes in biology is to extract meaningful insights from large, complex datasets. Researchers in ecology, evolution and behavior (EEB) often grapple with long-term, observational datasets from which they construct models to test causal hypotheses about biological processes. Similarly, epidemiologists analyse large, complex observational datasets to understand the distribution and determinants of human health. A key difference in the analytical workflows for these two distinct areas of biology is the delineation of data analysis tasks and explicit use of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), widely adopted by epidemiologists. Here, we review the most recent causal inference literature and describe an analytical workflow that has direct applications for EEB. We start this commentary by defining four distinct analytical tasks (description, prediction, association, causal inference). The remainder of the text is dedicated to causal inference, specifically focusing on the use of DAGs to inform the modelling strategy. Given the increasing interest in causal inference and misperceptions regarding this task, we seek to facilitate an exchange of ideas between disciplinary silos and provide an analytical framework that is particularly relevant for making causal inference from observational data.},

The key feature of such problems, which we exploit, is that variation in abundance induces variation in detection probability. Thus, heterogeneity in abundance can be modeled as heterogeneity in detection probability. Moreover, this linkage between heterogeneity in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability allows one to exploit a heterogeneous detection probability model to estimate the underlying distribution of abundances. Therefore, our method allows estimation of abundance from repeated observations of the presence or absence of animals without having to uniquely mark individuals in the population.},

	abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases in humans are frequently caused by pathogens originating from animal hosts, and zoonotic disease outbreaks present a major challenge to global health. To investigate drivers of virus spillover, we evaluated the number of viruses mammalian species have shared with humans. We discovered that the number of zoonotic viruses detected in mammalian species scales positively with global species abundance, suggesting that virus transmission risk has been highest from animal species that have increased in abundance and even expanded their range by adapting to human-dominated landscapes. Domesticated species, primates and bats were identified as having more zoonotic viruses than other species. Among threatened wildlife species, those with population reductions owing to exploitation and loss of habitat shared more viruses with humans. Exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade facilitates close contact between wildlife and humans, and our findings provide further evidence that exploitation, as well as anthropogenic activities that have caused losses in wildlife habitat quality, have increased opportunities for animal–human interactions and facilitated zoonotic disease transmission. Our study provides new evidence for assessing spillover risk from mammalian species and highlights convergent processes whereby the causes of wildlife population declines have facilitated the transmission of animal viruses to humans.},

Moreover, a simplified rodent disease model is discussed.},

In Asia alone, the rice loss every year caused by rodents could feed about 200 million people. Damage to crops in Africa and South America is equally dramatic. Rodent control often comes too late, is inefficient, or is considered too expensive. Using the multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) in Tanzania and the house mouse (Mus domesticus) in southeastern Australia as primary case studies, we demonstrate how ecology and economics can be combined to identify management strategies to make rodent control work more efficiently than it does today. Three more rodent–pest systems – including two from Asia, the rice-field rat (Rattus argentiventer) and Brandt's vole (Microtus brandti), and one from South America, the leaf-eared mouse (Phyllotis darwini) – are presented within the same bio-economic perspective. For all these species, the ability to relate outbreaks to interannual climatic variability creates the potential to assess the economic benefits of forecasting rodent outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Rodent pests are especially problematic in terms of agriculture and public health since they can inflict considerable economic damage associated with their abundance, diversity, generalist feeding habits and high reproductive rates. To quantify rodent pest impacts and identify trends in rodent pest research impacting on small-holder agriculture in the Afro-Malagasy region we did a systematic review of research outputs from 1910 to 2015, by developing an a priori defined set of criteria to allow for replication of the review process. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We reviewed 162 publications, and while rodent pest research was spatially distributed across Africa (32 countries, including Madagascar), there was a disparity in number of studies per country with research biased towards four countries (Tanzania [25\%], Nigeria [9\%], Ethiopia [9\%], Kenya [8\%]) accounting for 51\% of all rodent pest research in the Afro-Malagasy region. There was a disparity in the research themes addressed by Tanzanian publications compared to publications from the rest of the Afro-Malagasy region where research in Tanzania had a much more applied focus (50\%) compared to a more basic research approach (92\%) in the rest of the Afro-Malagasy region. We found that pest rodents have a significant negative effect on the Afro-Malagasy small-holder farming communities. Crop losses varied between cropping stages, storage and crops and the highest losses occurred during early cropping stages (46\% median loss during seedling stage) and the mature stage (15\% median loss). There was a scarcity of studies investigating the effectiveness of various management actions on rodent pest damage and population abundance. Our analysis highlights that there are inadequate empirical studies focused on developing sustainable control methods for rodent pests and rodent pests in the Africa-Malagasy context is generally ignored as a research topic.},

Our models predict reservoir status in this group with over 90\% accuracy, identifying species with high probabilities of harboring undiscovered zoonotic pathogens based on trait profiles that may serve as rules of thumb to distinguish reservoirs from nonreservoir species. Key predictors of zoonotic reservoirs include biogeographical properties, such as range size, as well as intrinsic host traits associated with lifetime reproductive output. Predicted hotspots of novel rodent reservoir diversity occur in the Middle East and Central Asia and the Midwestern United States.},

Here, we describe characteristics of animal reservoirs that are required for pathogen spillover. We assembled and analyzed a database of 330 disease systems in which a pathogen spills over from a reservoir of one or more species. Three-quarters of reservoirs included wildlife, and 84\% included mammals. Further, 65\% of pathogens depended on a community of reservoir hosts, rather than a single species, for persistence. Among mammals, the most frequently identified reservoir hosts were rodents, artiodactyls, and carnivores. The distribution among orders of mammalian species identified as reservoirs did not differ from that expected by chance. Among disease systems with high priority pathogens and epidemic potential, we found birds, primates, and bats to be overrepresented. We also analyzed the life history traits of mammalian reservoir hosts and compared them to mammals as a whole. Reservoir species had faster life history characteristics than mammals overall, exhibiting traits associated with greater reproductive output rather than long-term survival. Thus, we find that in many respects, reservoirs of spillover pathogens are indeed special. The described patterns provide a useful resource for studying and managing emerging infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {The multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis Smith 1834, is a dominant species in agro-ecosystems in Sub-Saharan Africa, but adapts quickly to changes in non-agricultural landscape, particularly woodlands and forests. In this study we report on reproduction and population dynamics of M. natalensis in deforested high elevation localities in the Usambara Mountains, north-east Tanzania. We conducted Capture-Mark-Recapture studies in 2002-2004, and established that reproduction of M. natalensis takes place in the extended wet season between February and June, and the population density peaks in June-August. Reproduction cease in July to January and population density drops from July onwards. Reproduction and population density fluctuations are linked to the duration and amount of rainfall. In years when rainfall was below average and the wet season was short, the population density was significantly lower (below 10 animals/ha and 60 animals/ha in 2003 and 2004 respectively, compared to {\textgreater}100 animals/ha in 2002 when rainfall was above the seasonal average) (Fdf 2,13= 9.092, p {\textless} 0.01 for in between years variations and Fdf 12,15= 5.389, p {\textless} 0.01 for effect of cumulative annual rainfall on population density). These densities were much lower than in the lowland savannah habitats in central and southwest Tanzania. A comparison between the farmland/fallow mosaic fields and agro–forestry areas showed higher population densities in the former, which have similarities to the preferred habitats in the lowland savannahs. The increasing abundance of M. natalensis in the Usambara could have some consequences: M. natalensis is major pest and is involved in the plague cycle in the western Usambara Mountains. Mastomys natalensis is also a strong competitor and the impact on endemic rodent species, e.g. Lophuromys flavopunctatus and Praomys delectorum is unknown.},

	abstract = {West Africa faces an increasing challenge related to water resources in the coming decades; hence high-confidence climate projection is crucial for the region’s future. In this study, future changes in summer monsoon rainfall under the RCP8.5 scenario were investigated over West Africa for the period of 2074–2099 with respect to the present-day period of 1980–2005 using the Rossby Centre Regional Climate Model (RCA4), driven by six Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) global circulation models (GCMs). Through evaluation of the present climate, the RCA4 simulations and their multi-model ensemble mean (EnsMean) reasonably reproduced the climatology of the summer rainfall and associated tropospheric circulation features. In a warmer climate, summer monsoon rainfall is projected to increase in most parts of West Africa, but a decrease is expected in the northwest, around Senegal. Changes in the monsoon circulation are opposite in the lower and upper troposphere, with the tipping point at 400 hPa. Specifically, a projected strengthening and northward shift is observed at the lower and mid-tropospheric level, while weakening is evident at the upper tropospheric level. A diagnosis based on a moisture budget equation reveals that the robust positive response of West African summer monsoon rainfall to global warming is largely explained by the enhancement of moisture convergence and surface evaporation.},

Between 8 February 2019 and 23 February 2020, a total of 371 samples (cloacal swabs = 259; faecal = 84; Sewage = 14, Tap water = 14) were collected. Characteristics of the sampled farms including management type, biosecurity, and history of disease were obtained using semi-structured questionnaire. Presumptive E. coli isolates were identified based on colony morphology with subsequent biochemical and PCR confirmation. Susceptibility of isolates was tested against a panel of 12 antimicrobials and interpreted alongside risk factor data obtained from the surveys. We isolated 717 E. coli samples from poultry and environmental samples. Our findings revealed that cloacal (17.8\%, 46/259), faecal (22.6\%, 19/84), sewage (14.3\%, 2/14) and tap water (7.1\%, 1/14) were significantly (p \&lt; 0.003) resistant to at least three classes of antimicrobials. Resistance to tetracycline class were predominantly observed in faecal samples (69\%, 58/84), followed by cloacal (64.1\%, 166/259), sewage (35.7\%, 5/14), and tap water (7.1\%, 1/84), respectively. Sewage water (OR = 7.22, 95\% CI = 0.95\&ndash;151.21) had significant association with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) acquisition. Multivariate regression analysis identified that the risk factors including sewage samples (OR = 7.43, 95\% CI = 0.96\&ndash;156.87) and farm size are leading drivers of E. coli antimicrobial resistance in the participating states of east coast peninsular Malaysia. We observed that the resistance patterns of E. coli isolates against 12 panel antimicrobials are generally similar in all selected states of east coast peninsular Malaysia. The highest prevalence of resistance was recorded in tetracycline (91.2\%), oxytetracycline (89.1\%), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (73.1\%), doxycycline (63\%), and sulfamethoxazole (63\%). A close association between different risk factors and the high prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli strains reflects increased exposure to resistant bacteria and suggests a concern over rising misuse of veterinary antimicrobials that may contribute to the future threat of emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogen isolates. Public health interventions to limit antimicrobial resistance need to be tailored to local poultry farm practices that affect bacterial transmission.},
