abstract: |

  An estimated 5% of the world's population are carriers for trait genes for haemoglobin disorders, mainly sickle cell disease. Over 75% of the global burden of sickle cell anaemia occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, and sickle cell disease is the most prevalent inherited genetic disease with 10â€“45% of the population carrying the sickle cell gene. 
  
  Advances in sickle cell disease management, including screening of newborn babies, pneumococcal prophylaxis, and hydroxyurea therapy have transformed sickle cell disease from a fatal childhood disease to a chronic condition of adulthood.
