	abstract = {An estimated 5\% of the world's population are carriers for trait genes for haemoglobin
disorders, mainly sickle cell disease. Over 75\% of the global burden of sickle cell
anaemia occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, and sickle cell disease is the most prevalent
inherited genetic disease with 10â€“45\% of the population carrying the sickle cell gene.
Advances in sickle cell disease management, including screening of newborn babies,
pneumococcal prophylaxis, and hydroxyurea therapy have transformed sickle cell disease
from a fatal childhood disease to a chronic condition of adulthood.},
