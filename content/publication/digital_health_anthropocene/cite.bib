	abstract = {In 2019, The Shift Project1 published a report to increase awareness of the environmental
effects of information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly smartphone
production and use, the multiplication of connected Internet of things (IoT) devices
(eg, smartwatches), and data traffic and storage. The conclusion of the report is
straightforward: trends in digital consumption are not sustainable with respect to
required energy and materials and systems-wide action is needed. Here, we aim to promote
reflection on the environmental implications of ICTs in the health sector.},
