  In 2019, The Shift Project1 published a report to increase awareness of the environmental effects of information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly smartphone production and use, the multiplication of connected Internet of things (IoT) devices (eg, smartwatches), and data traffic and storage. The conclusion of the report is straightforward: trends in digital consumption are not sustainable with respect to required energy and materials and systems-wide action is needed. Here, we aim to promote reflection on the environmental implications of ICTs in the health sector.
