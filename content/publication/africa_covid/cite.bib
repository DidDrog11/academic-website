	abstract = {Soon after the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV), was first identified in
a cluster of patients with pneumonia (Li et al., 2020), in the Chinese city of Wuhan
on 31 December 2019, rapid human to human transmission was anticipated (Hui et al.,
2020). The fast pace of transmission is wreaking havoc and stirring media hype and
public health concern (Ippolito et al., 2020) globally. When the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared the disease, (now officially named COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency
of International Concern (PHEIC) on 31st January 2020 (WHO, 2020a), the Director General
Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus justified the decision by stating that WHOs greatest concern
was the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems.},
