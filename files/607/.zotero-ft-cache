Abstract

Background: SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19, an emergent zoonotic disease which has reached pandemic levels and is designated a public health emergency of international concern. It is plausible that former or current smoking status is associated with infection, hospitalisation and/or mortality from COVID-19. Objective: We aimed to estimate the association of smoking status with rates of i) infection, ii) hospitalisation, iii) disease severity, and iv) mortality from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 disease. Methods: This is a living evidence review with frequent updates. We adopted recommended practice for rapid evidence reviews, which involved limiting the search to main databases and having one reviewer extract data and another verify. Published articles and pre-prints were identified via Ovid MEDLINE, medRxiv and expertise within the review team. We included observational or experimental studies with community-dwelling or hospitalised adults aged 16+ years who had received a test for SARS-CoV-2 infection or a diagnosis of COVID-19, providing that data on smoking status were reported. Studies were judged as ‘good’ quality if they: i) had low levels of missing data on smoking status (i.e. <20%) and used a reliable self-report measure that distinguished between current, former and never smoking status; AND ii) used biochemical verification of smoking status and reported results from adjusted analyses; OR reported data from a representative/random sample. Studies were rated as ‘fair’ if they fulfilled criterion i) only and were otherwise rated as ‘poor’. Results: Version 5 with searches up to 23 June 2020 included 148 studies, 43 of which were conducted in China, 37 in the US, 15 in the UK, nine in Mexico, nine in Spain, eight in France, six in Italy, five across multiple international sites, two in Israel, and one each from 14 further countries. Thirty-two (21.6%) studies reported current, former and never smoking status. Twenty-six studies (17.6%) explicitly reported the proportion missing data on smoking status, which ranged from 0.08% to 96.4%. Notwithstanding recording uncertainties, compared with adult national prevalence estimates, recorded current and former smoking rates were generally lower than expected. In 12 ‘fair’ quality studies, current smokers were at reduced risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with never smokers (RR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.55-0.88, p = .003, I2 = 90%). No significant difference was observed between former and never smokers (RR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.92-1.12, p = .76, I2 = 72%). In seven ‘fair’ quality studies, there was no significant difference between current and never (RR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.79-1.44, p = .63, I2 = 79%) or former and never smokers (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.95-1.51, p = .10, I2 = 79%) in the risk of requiring admission to hospital with COVID-19 among those testing positive in the community. In six ‘fair’ quality studies, no significant difference in disease severity was observed between current and never smokers (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.98-1.53, p = .08, I2 = 22%). Former smokers were at increased risk of greater disease severity compared with never smokers (RR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.07-2.32, p = .02, I2 = 68%). In five ‘fair’ quality studies, current (RR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.14-2.55, p = .01, I2 = 29%) and former smokers (RR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.57-2.55, p < .0.001, I2 = 0%) were at increased risk of in-hospital death compared with never smokers. Conclusions: Across 148 studies, there is substantial uncertainty about the associations of smoking with COVID-19 outcomes. The recorded smoking prevalence in the included studies was generally lower than overall adult national estimates. There was no evidence of reduced risk of admission to hospital for current compared with never smokers among those testing positive in the community. There was some evidence that current compared with never smoking is associated with reduced risk of testing positive in the community but also greater in-hospital mortality from COVID-19. There was some evidence that former compared with never smoking is associated with increased risk of greater disease severity and in-hospital mortality from COVID-19. Implications: Unrelated to COVID-19, smokers are at a greater risk of a range of serious health problems. Given uncertainty around the association of smoking with COVID-19 outcomes, smoking cessation remains a public health priority and high-quality smoking cessation advice including recommendations to use alternative nicotine products should form part of public health efforts during this pandemic. High quality, smoking-specific research is needed to resolve these mixed findings.

Introduction

 

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus. Large age and gender differences in case severity and mortality have been observed in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic 1 ; however, these differences are currently unexplained. SARS-CoV-2 enters epithelial cells through the ACE-2 receptor 2 . Some evidence suggests that gene expression and subsequent receptor levels are elevated in the airway and oral epithelium of current smokers 3,4 , thus putting smokers at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Other studies, however, suggest that nicotine downregulates the ACE-2 receptor 5 . These uncertainties notwithstanding, both former and current smoking is known to increase the risk of respiratory viral 6,7 and bacterial 8,9 infections and is associated with worse outcomes once infected. Cigarette smoke reduces the respiratory immune defence through peri-bronchiolar inflammation and fibrosis, impaired mucociliary clearance and disruption of the respiratory epithelium 10 . There is also reason to believe that behavioural factors (e.g. regular hand-to-mouth movements) involved in smoking may increase SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in current smokers. However, early data from the COVID-19 pandemic have not provided clear evidence for a negative impact of current or former smoking on SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease outcomes, such as hospitalisation or mortality 11 . It has also been hypothesised that nicotine might protect against a hyper-inflammatory response (or “cytokine storm”) to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may lead to adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 disease 12 .

 

There are several reviews that fall within the scope of smoking and COVID-19 11,13–17 . We aimed to produce a rapid synthesis of available evidence pertaining to the rates of infection, hospitalisation, disease severity and mortality from SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 stratified by smoking status. Given the increasing availability of data on this topic, this is a living review with regular updates. As evidence accumulates, the review will be expanded to include studies reporting COVID-19 outcomes by alternative nicotine use (e.g., nicotine replacement therapy or e-cigarettes).

 

Methods

 

Study design

This is a living evidence review which is updated as new evidence becomes available 18 . We adopted recommended practice for rapid evidence reviews, which involved limiting the search to main databases and having one reviewer extract the data and another verify 19 .

Eligibility criteria

 

Studies were included if they:

 

1)      Were primary research studies using experimental (e.g. randomised controlled trial), quasi-experimental (e.g. pre- and post-test) or observational (e.g. case-control, retrospective cohort, prospective cohort) study designs;

2)      Included adults aged 16+ years;

3)      Recorded as outcome i) results of a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test (including antibody assays), ii) clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, iii) hospitalisation with COVID-19, iv) severity of COVID-19 disease in those hospitalised or v) mortality from COVID-19;

4)      Reported any of the outcomes of interest by self-reported or biochemically verified smoking status (e.g. current smoker, former smoker, never smoker);

5)      Were available in English;

6)      Were published in a peer-reviewed journal, as a pre-print or a public health report by reputable agents (e.g. governments, scientific societies).

The following terms were searched for in titles, abstracts and full texts in medRxiv:

 

covid smoking

covid nicotine

covid vaping

 

Additional articles/reports of interest were identified through mailing lists, Twitter, the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC), the Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

 

Where updated versions of pre-prints or public health reports were available, old versions were superseded.

 

Selection of studies

 

One reviewer screened titles, abstracts and full texts against the inclusion criteria.

 

Data extraction

 

Data were extracted by one reviewer and verified by a second on i) author (year); ii) date published; iii) country; iv) study design; v) study setting; vi) sample size; vii) sex; viii) age; ix) smoking status (e.g. current, former, never, not stated, missing); x) SARS-CoV-2 infection; xi) diagnosis of COVID-19; xii) hospitalisation with COVID-19; xiii) disease severity in those hospitalised with COVID-19; and xiv) mortality.

 

Quality appraisal

 

In previous review versions, we used the National Institutes of Health’s Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies to determine the quality of included studies 20 . However, we decided against applying the entire tool in the current review version. The appraisal is challenging to apply when studying an emerging disease with unknown pathology. For example, it is not possible to determine what proportion of eligible participants/patients are included in the studied populations when the total number of infections in a given region/city is unknown. With a largely unknown disease process, it is also difficult to determine whether the time between the exposure and outcome is sufficient. We therefore focused on three of the 14 criteria to determine whether studies were of sufficient quality to warrant inclusion in meta-analysis. Studies were judged as ‘good’ quality if they: i) had low levels of missing data on smoking status (i.e. <20%) and used a reliable self-report measure that distinguished between current, former and never smoking status; AND ii) used biochemical verification of smoking status and reported results from adjusted analyses; OR reported data from a representative/random sample. Studies were rated as ‘fair’ if they fulfilled only criterion i) and were otherwise rated as ‘poor’. The quality appraisal was conducted by one reviewer and verified by a second.

 

Evidence synthesis

 

A narrative synthesis was conducted. Where possible, data were pooled in R v.3.6.3 21 with the Mantel-Haenszel or inverse variance method using random or fixed effects, depending on heterogeneity, and presented as risk ratios (RRs) 22 . Heterogeneity between study outcomes was assessed using the I2 statistic, suitable for smaller meta‐analyses 23 .

To aid in the visualisation of smoking prevalence in the included studies, 95% bootstrap percentile confidence intervals were calculated for each study estimate. We performed 1,000 bootstrap replications, with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the empirical distribution forming the 95% bootstrap percentile confidence intervals 24 . It should be noted that prevalence estimates in the included studies were not adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position, or region within countries.

 

Results

 

In the current review version (v5), a total of 636 new records were identified, with 148 studies included in a narrative synthesis and 23 studies included in meta-analyses (see Figure 1).

Study characteristics

 

Characteristics of included studies are presented in Table 1. Forty-three studies were conducted in China, 37 in the US, 15 in the UK, nine in Mexico, nine in Spain, eight in France, six in Italy, five across multiple international sites, two in Israel, and one each from Brazil, Chile, Denmark, Finland, Germany, India, Iran, South Korea, Kuwait, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and Turkey (see Figure 2). One-hundred-and-five studies were conducted in hospital settings. Thirty-four studies included a community component in addition to hospitalised patients. Seven studies were conducted exclusively in the community, one in a quarantine centre and one did not state the study setting. Studies had a median of 326 (interquartile range = 106-1,122) participants.

Smoking status

 

Categorisation of smoking status was heterogeneous (see Table 1). Ninety-two studies collected data on smoking status through routine electronic health records, 35 studies used a bespoke case report form for COVID-19 and 21 studies did not state the source for information on smoking status. None of the studies verified smoking status biochemically. Notably, only 32 (21.6%) studies reported current, former and never smoking status, with a further 11 studies reporting current/former and never smoking status. The remaining 105 studies reported current, current/former or current and former smoking status but did not explicitly state whether remaining participants were never smokers or if data were missing on smoking status. Twenty-six studies explicitly reported the proportion with missing data on smoking status, which ranged from 0.08% to 96.4%.

 

Use of alternative nicotine products

 

Two studies recorded the use of alternative nicotine products in current and/or former smokers but did not report COVID-19 outcomes stratified by nicotine use 25,26 .

 

Quality appraisal

 

Twenty-eight studies were rated as ‘fair’ quality due to having low levels of missing data and distinguishing between current, former and never smoking status (see Table 1). The remaining 120 studies were rated as ‘poor’ quality.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Smoking prevalence by country

 

Unadjusted smoking prevalence compared with overall estimates for national adult smoking prevalence split by country and study setting is presented in Figure 3a and 3b. Lower than expected current and former smoking prevalence was generally observed. Large variability in prevalence estimates was observed across studies conducted in the US.

SARS-CoV-2 infection by smoking status

 

Twenty-five studies provided data on SARS-CoV-2 test results for people meeting local testing criteria by smoking status (see Table 2). Meta-analyses were performed for 12 ‘fair’ quality studies (see Figure 4 and 5). Current smokers were at reduced risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with never smokers (RR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.55-0.88, p = .003, I 2 = 90%). No significant difference was observed between former and never smokers (RR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.92-1.12, p = .76, I 2 = 72%).

Hospitalisation for COVID-19 by smoking status

 

Twenty-one studies examined hospitalisation for COVID-19 disease stratified by smoking status (see Table 3). Meta-analyses were performed for seven ‘fair’ quality studies (see Figure 6 and 7). There was no significant difference between current and never (RR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.79-1.44, p = .63, I 2 = 79%) or former and never smokers (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.95-1.51, p = .10, I 2 = 79%) in the risk of requiring admission to hospital with COVID-19.

Disease severity by smoking status

 

Forty studies reported disease severity in hospitalised patients stratified by smoking status (see Table 4). Severe (as opposed to non-severe) disease was broadly defined as requiring ITU admission, requiring oxygen as a hospital inpatient or in-hospital death. Meta-analyses were performed for six ‘fair’ quality studies (see Figure 8 and 9). No significant difference was observed between current and never smokers (RR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.98-1.53,  p = .08, I 2 = 22%). Former smokers were at increased risk of greater disease severity compared with never smokers (RR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.07-2.32, p = .02, I 2 = 68%).

Mortality by smoking status

 

Thirty studies reported mortality from COVID-19 by smoking status (see Table 5), with five ‘fair’ quality studies included in meta-analyses (see Figure 10 and 11). Current (RR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.14-2.55, p = .01, I 2 = 29%) and former (RR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.57-2.55, p < .0.001, I 2 = 0%) smokers were at increased risk of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 compared with never smokers.

Discussion

 

This rapid review of 148 studies found substantial uncertainty arising from the recording of smoking status. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, compared with overall adult national prevalence estimates, recorded current and former smoking rates in most countries were lower than expected. From available data, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that current and/or former smoking status is associated with hospitalisation. There was some evidence from ‘fair’ quality studies that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is reduced in current compared with never smokers. Conversely, former compared with never smokers were at increased risk of greater disease severity in those hospitalised for COVID-19. Both current and former smokers had increased risk of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 compared with never smokers.

 

Infection by smoking status

 

In 12 ‘fair’ quality studies, evidence suggests that current smokers in the community are less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with never smokers. It should be noted that criteria for accessing testing will vary during the course of the epidemic. It is possible that current and former smokers are more likely to receive a test due to increased prevalence of cough or altered sense of smell or taste 172 , which are used as screening criteria. Infection positivity rates estimated among random samples will be more informative than currently available data. Smoking status is being collected in at least two large representative infection and antibody surveys in the UK 173,174 .

 

Hospitalisation and disease severity by smoking status

 

As reported elsewhere 175 , smoking prevalence among multiple hospital and community cohorts was consistently lower than national estimates. In a single study conducted in Korea and 15 studies of varying quality conducted in the UK, however, current and former smoking rates were more similar to expected national estimates.

 

In seven ‘fair’ quality studies across four countries, there was no evidence that current or former smokers are at lower risk of hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with never smokers among those testing positive in the community. There was some evidence from six ‘fair’ quality studies that former (but insufficient evidence that current) smokers are at increased risk of greater disease severity compared with never smokers.

 

Mortality by smoking status

 

In five ‘fair’ quality studies, there was some evidence that current and former smokers are at increased risk of in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 compared with never smokers. It should, however, be noted that given lack of knowledge of the disease progression and long-term outcomes of COVID-19 disease, it is unclear whether studies conducted thus far in the pandemic have monitored patients for a sufficient time period to report complete survival outcomes or whether they are subject to early censoring.

 

Issues complicating interpretation

 

Interpretation of results from studies conducted during the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is complicated by several factors (see Figure 11). First, exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is heterogeneous with different subgroups at heightened risk of infection at different stages of the pandemic. This will likely introduce bias in studies assessing the rate of infection by smoking status conducted early on. Second, as mentioned above, current and former smokers may be more likely to meet local criteria for community testing due to increased prevalence of symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as cough, increased sputum production or altered sense of smell or taste 172 . Third, testing for acute infection requires swabbing of the mucosal epithelium, which may be disrupted in current smokers, potentially altering the sensitivity of assays 88 .

 

Fourth, most included studies relied on electronic health records (EHRs) as the source of information on smoking status. Research shows large discrepancies between EHRs and actual behaviour 176 . Known failings of EHRs include implausible longitudinal changes, such as former smokers being recorded as never smokers at subsequent hospital visits 176 . Misreporting on the part of the patient (perhaps due to perceived stigmatisation) has also been observed, with biochemical measures showing higher rates of smoking compared with self-report in hospitalised patients in the US 177 . It is hence possible that under-reporting of current and former smoking status in hospitals occurred across the included studies. Fifth, individuals with severe COVID-19 symptoms may have stopped smoking immediately before admission to hospital and may therefore not have been recorded as current smokers (i.e. reverse causality).

 

Sixth, smokers with COVID-19 may be less likely to receive a SARS-CoV-2 test or present to hospital due to lack of access to healthcare and may be more likely to die in the community from sudden complications (i.e. self-selection bias) and thus not be recorded. Seventh, if there is a protective effect of nicotine on COVID-19 disease outcomes, abrupt nicotine withdrawal upon hospitalisation may lead to worse outcomes 12 . Eight, during periods of heightened demand of limited healthcare resources, current and former smokers with extensive comorbidities may have reduced priority for intensive care admission, thus leading to higher in-hospital mortality.

 

Another important issue is that the reason for hospitalisation varies by country and time in the pandemic. For example, early cases may have been hospitalised for isolation and quarantine reasons and not due to medical necessity. It is plausible that this may have skewed early data towards less severe cases. In addition, the observed association between former smoking and greater disease severity may be explained by collider bias 178 , where conditioning on a collider (e.g. testing or hospitalisation) by design or analysis may introduce a spurious association between current or former smoking (a potential cause of testing or hospitalisation) and SARS-CoV-2 infection/adverse outcomes from COVID-19 (potentially exacerbated by smoking) 179 .

Limitations

 

This living rapid evidence review was limited by not having two independent reviewers extracting data, limiting the search to one electronic database and one pre-print server and by not including at least three large population surveys due to their reliance on self-reported suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection (which means they do not meet our eligibility criteria) 172,180,181 . Population surveys – particularly with linked health data – will be included in future review versions to help mitigate some of the limitations of healthcare based observational studies. . The comparisons of current and former smoking prevalence in the included studies with national prevalence estimates did not adjust observed prevalence for the demographic profile of those tested/admitted to hospital. Other reviews focused on this comparison have applied adjustment for sex, and continue to find lower than expected prevalence – notwithstanding the issues complicating interpretation described above 16 .  Future versions of the review will take a Bayesian approach to the comparisons to mitigate the issue of repeating multiple meta-analyses across different versions of this living review.

 

Implications for research, policy and practice

 

Further scientific research is needed to resolve the mixed findings summarised in our review. First, clinical trials of the posited therapeutic effect of nicotine could have important implications both for smokers and for improved understanding of how the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes disease in humans. Such trials should focus on medicinal nicotine (as smoked tobacco is a dirty delivery mechanism that could mask beneficial effects) and potentially differentiate between different modes of delivery (i.e. inhaled vs. ingested) since this can affect pharmacokinetics 182 and potential therapeutic effects. A second research priority would be a large, representative (randomly sampled) population survey with a validated assessment of smoking status which distinguishes between recent and long-term ex-smokers – ideally biochemically verified – and assesses seroprevalence and links to health records.

 

In the meantime, public-facing messages about the possible protective effect of smoking or nicotine are premature. In our view, until there is further research, the quality of the evidence does not justify the huge risk associated with a message likely to reach millions of people that a lethal activity, such as smoking, may protect against COVID-19. It continues to be appropriate to recommend smoking cessation and emphasise the role of alternative nicotine products to support smokers to stop as part of public health efforts during COVID-19. At the very least, smoking cessation reduces acute risks from cardiovascular disease and could reduce demands on the healthcare system 183 . GPs and other healthcare providers can play a crucial role – brief, high-quality and free online training is available at National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training.

 

Conclusion

 

Across 148 studies, there is substantial uncertainty arising from the recording of smoking status on whether current and/or former smoking status is associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation or mortality. There is some evidence that current smoking compared with never is associated with reduced risk of testing positive in the community but greater in-hospital mortality from COVID-19. There is some evidence that former compared with never smoking is associated with increased risk of greater disease severity and in-hospital mortality from COVID-19.

    The living review is a great idea that could provide a useful contribution to a hot topic. On most outcomes though, smokers were merged with ex-smokers. (The conclusion that 'current and former smoking is associated with greater disease severity' implies this is true for both of these groups, rather than for the merged sample of ever-smokers).

    The counterintuitive hypothesis that is making waves and that is in urgent need of further testing is that current smoking (rather than smoking in the past) may provide a degree of protection (Qeios 561, 574, 581). 

    Can you show the results for smokers and for ex-smokers separately?
